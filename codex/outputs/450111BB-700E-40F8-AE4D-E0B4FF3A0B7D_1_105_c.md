This is my Report 1  
In the spring of 1952, I felt the urge to go outside, and I found work in Beamsville  
at a large gardening company that exported rose bushes all over the world.  
Yes, even to Holland! Many immigrants worked there, most of them had settled in—  
The owners knew why, so the men were assigned by visa and  
media. So, building began right away in the spring in Niagara-on-the-Lake.  
My debts for the passage were paid off by building, where then the building in  
Motels and theaters were built by us, where the Shaw Festival then took place.  
The men 50 cents. The workers paid off their passage by building, where then the building in  
Obligated for two years, as a repayment for the arrangement, the workers  
weekly. There, I met an acquaintance in the first and second, and  
backwards, and the forward and backward, to take the test.  
An acquaintance drove with me. To a neighboring village, where the test took place.  
Test drive was also done on a traffic road. It went well, I got  
a driver’s license. I was quite good at parking, but  
you can say that it was a slow drive home in the dark, and one  
had never driven before on a traffic road. It went  
driver’s license. Now I quickly had to learn everything about diabetes and I worked in  
a canning factory—learned about fruit and end-in  
in the kitchen. There I quickly learned everything about diabetes and I worked in  
hospital as an “Assistant Dietitian.” With my friend, where  
Sherbourne Street, just a few houses away from Dr. Goegginger’s church. So it  
wasn’t long before we ended up at a worship service. Afterwards  
street, what you could do on Sundays. Since I had a car, meeting at the  
happiest time was an outing with the youth group. That was the start of a  
singles’ group for young people, and together we were a family. I moved to  
Vancouver, but the memories and the few years with the friends from the  
youth group will remain forever.
