Dear Mother!  
How are you? I just want to quickly write to you about the apple prices at the wholesale market in Frankfurt. Cox’s Orange we sell for 48 and 50 pfennigs per pound, though some are sold for even lower prices. The large ones, however, are very nice. Goldparmäne are sluggish. 25 pfennigs, but quality is not as good as A. There are also some for 32 pfennigs. Boskoop Rop 20 to 25 pfennigs, however, they are not particularly nice. We are not selling any Boskoops yet. In bulk, seeds are now being sold as Core at 70 pfennigs.
