Hofheim, July 19, 1951.

Dear Mother!

Now the whole England matter is obsolete. Yesterday
news came from the Canadian immigration office in Karlsruhe.
I am getting a visa, and I have to go
to Karlsruhe for an examination on the afternoon of August 17th.
They wrote to me that German girls are very
sought after over there, and they will give me a letter of recommendation here,
so that I can get a job right away when I arrive. Just
the day before yesterday there was an article in our daily newspaper,
about how warmly the Germans are being received over there. You don’t mind,
do you? You know, I had stopped believing in it,
that’s why I did that thing with England. If
you need me in a couple of years, I’ll gladly come
back again. For the medical examination
on August 17th, I have to bring an X-ray,
a valid passport and references from three people
who can vouch for my good character and honesty.
Mr. Betzel can write me one, but who
else should I take? And then I also need another
statement from you for my passport to Canada. Please
send it to me as soon as possible. I’m sorry that
I always have to bother you with these things, but next
year I’ll be 21.
