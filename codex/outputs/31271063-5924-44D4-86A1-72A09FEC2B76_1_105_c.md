Dear Christel!  
How are you? Have you grown a bit more and become plumper? When I come back, you will surely pick me up in your arms. I, on the other hand, am not getting any taller or plumper, because it seems one gets thinner in this climate. Here, the women are all as slim as fir trees. If they all eat as little as we do here, it's no wonder. Mrs. Duggan doesn't eat anything at all in the morning; at lunch, we have soup and toast, or eggs with ham and always dessert. In the evenings, up to now, there has always been mashed potatoes, and everyone eats at most a tablespoonful of it. Then, some kind of canned or frozen vegetables are opened and warmed up, and with that, there is meat in large quantities. A big little lump of butter goes into everything. For dessert, there is very often ice cream. Most things you can buy here in cans, but they don't all taste like one single spice! You really couldn't cook better than this. The finest vegetable soups, chicken with rice, green peas, preserved fruit, spaghetti with tomatoes, etc. As for food, leftovers, and slices of bread that are thrown away here—you could feed a family of four and two fat pigs with it. The only thing that is kept carefully is the mashed potatoes, because potatoes have to be peeled.

Best regards and a happy new year!  
Dora.
