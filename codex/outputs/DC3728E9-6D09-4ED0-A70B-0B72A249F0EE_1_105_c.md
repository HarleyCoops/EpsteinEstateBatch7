Dear Bärbel! How are you? How is your school report card? Have you improved? Will you be promoted at Easter? Here, the children in elementary school don't have to do any homework, but for that, they also have school at midday. I am often alone with the two boys; you should see what they get up to! If I knew more English, I would tell them stories or read to them. But I hardly think that would be much enjoyment for them. 

So we play football in the midst of silverware and crystal and chandeliers. I am the defender then. The children have heavy colds and have to stay inside. The other day, four-year-old Teddy got hold of his mother's nail polish and painted the radiator, the floors, and his own toenails. I had a couple of hours' work afterwards, because Mrs. Duggan naturally uses only first-quality products, and they last. Today the children went Christmas shopping with their mother. 

Advent has not been celebrated at all here, and they don’t know about St. Nicholas either. I haven’t heard anyone singing Christmas carols yet. But the children do know "Silent Night," thank God! In Niagara Falls, there are three cheap days for shopping. The shop windows are decorated, but mostly with artificial stuff and electric things, but they do know Christmas trees here, even artificial palm branches.

Billie is playing "Oh du lieber Augustin!" on the piano. Have a wonderful Christmas. This year you’ll have space! Many greetings from Dorli.
