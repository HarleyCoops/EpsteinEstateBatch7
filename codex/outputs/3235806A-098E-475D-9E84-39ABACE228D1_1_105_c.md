To the company  
Steffen, Rittershaus  
Bodensee  

Dear Mr. Bezel,

In response to your advertisement in the Tages-Post of 2 February 1949, I would like to inquire about the salary. I worked in a family-run business, where I also worked with my three certified relatives. The business is 3 hectares in size, primarily arable farming, and I am experienced as a farmer. I performed various tasks and also attended horticultural vocational school as a farmer. I have passed the examination.

I am now in another professional position for 3 years, but would like to further expand my knowledge in another business.

Respectfully,  
Dora Hofstetter
