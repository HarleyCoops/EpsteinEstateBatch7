Is Arlette here now?  
Our assistant, who has been here for 3 days, is nothing special. He knows almost nothing about fruit growing.  
The girl is very nice and hardworking. But she won’t stay, because she wants to go to the American. There she earns, besides board and lodging, 150 DM.  
Does Ursel still not have a job? On the one hand, it’s good that she’s still here.  
It’s really unfortunate that Dagmar had such bad luck.  
Has Erdmuthe ever written to you? I’ll write her a birthday letter later. Käthe also has her birthday next week. She would surely be happy if Uli or someone else wrote to her.  
We’re starting with the shade morellos now, we have quite a lot of them. I’ve only been swimming once.  
Best regards,  
Dorle.  
Ute seems to have a lot to do as well, she hasn’t written to me in ages.
