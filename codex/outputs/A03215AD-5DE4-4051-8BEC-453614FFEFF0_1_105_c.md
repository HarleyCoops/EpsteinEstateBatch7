to get in. And now to Argentina, where they make quite nasty difficulties, especially for young women traveling alone. I don't know which zone you belong to in Hofheim, probably the American one. In that case, it will be no problem for you to inquire about everything you need to know there. For heaven's sake, young lady, do not let yourself be tempted by romantic ideas—by orchids, hummingbirds, palm trees, and other such romantic vegetable varieties; here, too, they only cook with water, and in many places with what kind of water at that. The faithful Indians and the self-sacrificing Black slaves must definitely be left to the realm of good literature for more mature youth. In reality, you'll most probably have your handbag with your passport, travel money, etc. stolen in the very first port, and it would not be the first time that the dream of romance in the overseas countries comes to a swift and painful end. I can, unfortunately, provide you with many examples.

Note.

So, Fraulein Hofmann, that is what I have to say to you.
I have deliberately been a bit more detailed than might have been necessary, but I did not want to lay myself open to the accusation of indifference, as sometimes happens when "the other only hears the no from everything."
Please, think through your plans very, very carefully,
and perhaps it is still the wisest thing if you keep your beautiful youth for your parents and good old faraway Germany for quite a bit longer before you cross the famous big pond.
I am sending this letter to you via my niece Erdmuthe. There are, unfortunately, no secrets in it (once again the cursed romance)—and I assume the contents of the letter, even if not exactly encouraging, may also not be uninteresting to my niece Erdmuthe. Besides, then I don't have to write such a long letter to that girl, too.

Best regards
from your
Dr. Schumann
