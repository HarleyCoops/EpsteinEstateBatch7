so sweet. Also apricots and cherries,  
peaches. The oldest trees are  
20 years old. Strangely, we were all  
horusche. Those or the desert a Horuen  
are the shoots on them. Yesterday  
I wanted to go to Wiesbaden, but it  
rained and rained the whole day.  
On Saturday evening, I was at a  
lecture about Angola (Portuguese  
West Africa). It was very interesting.  
The group as well. It seemed that  
Uncle Kaum also wants to go there. Here  
there is also an America House. Discussions,  
films, English language courses, lectures,  
all free of charge. In addition, there is a  
people’s education society which also  
organizes many events. You or Übersetz  
cher are supposed to be his judge.  
Best regards, Dorl.
