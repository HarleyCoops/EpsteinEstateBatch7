Dayton, Ohio, 6. 11. 51

Dear Uncle,

I have now been in the U.S.A. for over 14 days and have
somewhat settled in. In Washington, we first had
introductory lectures and now everyone has their
fixed travel program. I am traveling with a
companion with whom I get along very well.
From here we go to Chicago and then
for a month to the state of Utah to the Mormons,
which I am especially looking forward to.
Now I would very much like to know what news you have
from Doris in Canada. It really isn't
so easy to get used to a foreign language.
I am often surprised at how much I still miss when
the people speak quickly, even though I thought
I could speak English. I also wanted to
write you the address of Mrs. Taffas Tondu in Canada,
which I have now learned. She will probably stay there until
the beginning of December because she has to recover from an illness.
If you or Doris would like to write to her,
the address is:

Mrs. Elly Graeffe
% Mr. Bob Ellis
305 Lee Ave
Toronto Ontario
Canada

My own address is:
Woman's Bureau 1338
Department of Labour
Washington
U.S.A.

Warm greetings to all of you and Merry Christmas!
Your Erni.
