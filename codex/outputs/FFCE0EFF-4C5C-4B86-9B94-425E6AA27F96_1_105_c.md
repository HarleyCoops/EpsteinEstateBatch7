their considerably higher standard of living over there cannot in any way be compared to the local views on the social status of a domestic servant. One should, for God's sake, not have any illusions about this.

To return once again to fruit cultivation: all our wisdom in this field always comes from California, whose climate and conditions for the cultivation of various types of fruit are approximately similar to ours, but which are, from a technical standpoint, far, far ahead of us, because the possibilities and demands for product quality are, naturally, different in a country with 120 million inhabitants than in a country with 5 million inhabitants, as old Chile has.

If I am to give you any advice, and if you really want to poke your 19-year-old nose abroad, then try California. There you can really learn a lot; many young women work in such agricultural establishments there, as we can see in the pictures in the American trade journals, and often they are very pretty girls (or maybe only those appear in the newspapers). If you have learned a lot more in California, then take your time returning home, and travel back via South America. That is definitely worth it, because you can see many interesting things and, above all, scenic beauties that you will never forget in your life. I can promise you that with a clear conscience. But to come here to work in your profession, and even to earn good money, do not, for God's sake, come here for that.
