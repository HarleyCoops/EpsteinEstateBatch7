Dear Mother, earlier your letter arrived.
And your vacation is very short.
Because Klaus’ bathtub is finished, he’s also leaving on 1.12. So
once again Aries Wal is there,
I would really like to see him again.
Everyone tells me if
it is a very great joy.
Now on 3.12., Bouffiert
is big at the construction. I need under-
wear, pajamas. Then I want
to buy myself a little dress for
Sundays, when Klaus comes.
Cheaper than in the store.
Then I also need 1 or 2
work trousers, an apron,
and a good jacket for around the house. And
I really need the wool coat,
I’m knitting Klaus a sweater,
he really does want one after all.
