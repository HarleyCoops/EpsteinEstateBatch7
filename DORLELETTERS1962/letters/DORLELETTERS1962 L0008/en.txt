Merry Christmas
and a
Happy New Year
from
Eric, Jule, André and
Christopher.

Dear Ursel! I wish you happy
days and a good new year.
It's already known, a given,
whether I was in the hospital or just
endured it there, but not since,
and I wouldn't do it again =
because I thought that perhaps you
might come then. If you don't want to,
there's cinnamon oil or mother's
drops. André is also coming on the 1st or 2nd
for a visit, when he's there, then
he beams over his whole face. André
also makes a big fuss
when he wants something to drink, or to eat.
Then he always makes sure to have his oil drops
first. He is, for his frequency range,
when he drops it, he plugs his ear.
Crocheting is no big deal to him, if he
loses it, and his furry jumper
is already barking at him. André is now coming onto the sofa =
cries, sometimes he screams, everything out

You light,
from
dear
God
sent
into our
dark
earthly land...
