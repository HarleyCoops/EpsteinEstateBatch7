  "reason": "Both pages are written on 'Holland-America Line' stationery. The first page is dated 'Jan 4/62' and addressed to 'Liebe Ulla!', discussing wedding preparations. The second page continues the letter, thanking Ulla for a calendar and signing off from 'Dein Onkel'. The content flows logically from one page to the next."
