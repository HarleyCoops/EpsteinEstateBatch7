  "reason": "These two pages appear to be a Christmas card/letter to 'Liebe Ursel!' from 'Onkel'. The first page has a pre-printed Christmas greeting, a personal note, and mentions 'Andri'. The second page continues mid-sentence, describing a child's behavior (likely Andri's) and ends with a closing from 'Dein Onkel'. The content seems to flow, but the OCR quality is poor, making the connection less certain. The names 'Eric, Jale, Andri und Christopher' on the card are likely the family of the sender."
