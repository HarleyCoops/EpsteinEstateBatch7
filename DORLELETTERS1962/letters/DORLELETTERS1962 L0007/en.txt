Merry Christmas
and a
Happy New Year

from
Eric, Jale, Andri and
Christopher.

Dear Ursel! I wish you a happy
holiday season and a happy new year.
The bed jacket is a gift for you,
I wore it when I was in the hospital,
but not since then, and I haven't
washed it. I thought that you might be able
to use it. If you don't want it,
give it to
Christel or Mother.
Otherwise, Andri takes care of him every
time he just hears him, then
his whole face lights up. Andri
also spends a lot of time with him; when
he wants something to drink, or to eat,
he always takes care of everything, right down
to the serious things. He gives him his toy back
when he drops it, shoves the
bottle back into his throat when he
loses it, and will soon be fingering his fur.
Andri is now learning to stand up,
and sometimes he throws everything out of

You light,

the dust bunnies when he's supposed to be sleeping.
He then gathers everything up again, he
cuddles, but only with soft
things. He loves to lick the table.
Lately, he always wants to be on the phone.
It hurts him when he leaves the room
or dusts. It is also a great
risk, what he cannot yet say.
He nibbled on a victim of a pinecone
to show what the squirrel
does. Now he takes a nap with his big but quiet parents
every week. He
is fed more, frozen and
experiences the whole year again. As soon as
we can, we'll also buy a goose
or a duck with a somewhat sharper
"disgust," cherry or Rell, that's a
good riddle. Best regards, Your Uncle.
