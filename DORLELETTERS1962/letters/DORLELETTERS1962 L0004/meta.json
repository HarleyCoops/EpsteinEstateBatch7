  "reason": "A three-page letter from 'Wanda' and 'Eric' to 'Mutti' dated 'Banff, Dezember 17, 62'. The first page starts the letter, wishing a merry Christmas and describing the move to Banff. The second page continues the description of setting up the new home. The third page concludes with Christmas wishes and is signed 'Eure Wanda'. The OCR quality is poor, but the date, location, topic (moving to Banff, Christmas), and names are consistent."
