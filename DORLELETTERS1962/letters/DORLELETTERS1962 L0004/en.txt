Banff, December 17, 62

Dear Mother!

We both wish you a
merry Christmas and peaceful
holidays. Are there three of
you now for
Christmas, or is he
not at home for Christmas,
and has Bärbel already started
her [job/position]?
Yes, whether I will be here for Christmas,
or if I came in addition to
that, is the big question. Since
so much has already happened this week,
a lot could change about Christmas
in Vancouver. The day before yesterday I drove
my VW, and it was full of
luggage. It went quite well, for
the 500 km. For the last stretch,
we had snow and ice on the
road. Now I am still very
busy with moving in
and unpacking and organizing.
On Saturday we are driving to Calgary to buy
furniture. For now, we only need two mattresses
to sleep on ourselves, since we always
push the mattresses in the living
room anyway. The baby will sleep in the bathroom and
sleep in a homemade box and
a low bench, and a lot of
things. The doctor thought Berti could
go. And we had a visit from his
parents. Well, now we know
we have to cook for ourselves, since I
have landed in Banff. I rode
in the truck, our own, and we
took two days for the
400 km through the mountains.

things. For the children's room, we have so far
the cradle, a changing table, and a dresser, the things you
will need over time. For the children, we
bought a so-called group table, which is a
cabinet when it's not in use. Without that:
for stocking up, we will get a chest freezer
to freeze fruit, and of course vegetables too.
It's too expensive to always buy fresh fruit. I still have some in Vancouver
that I made, it probably doesn't smell in there, just like in a refrigerator.
Eric comes home for lunch, which is much
easier than cooking beans or lentils.

made out for Barbis, which I can
do now, put it somewhere, or carry the baby
in my arm or on my back.
or a little bed, when the little child
can sit up alone without hip support.
I can go shopping, and I wanted to
see if I should buy anything else.
I know what I need, and I
although I packed everything up again,
Christmas tree eyes and that went
well. Have you received my package?
I've never sent one so late. Hopefully,
I had so much time, but I have ready-made baked goods, Nikola Grit:
den and honey cake. The cake, as Wanda has enough of:
them, because Gatti is not supposed to bowl. He won a crate
as a consolation prize because he was the worst. (This whole
bowling thing is a story in itself. When I was bowling,
he had to wait until Antijaden was alone, then he went with him. Now
he doesn't bake many kinds anymore, and for himself
not much either. With the bowling, Eric often
had the goal of being the worst.) And for themselves,
"Japanese oranges," as Gatti calls them, and Plätzchen cookies
that they made. Then once a year in Canada, there's a nice hot drink, it's only available
once every four weeks at Christmas. The same
goes for "Eggnog," a mixture of eggs, cake, and
a sweet drink that is mild and innocent. That's what Christmas is like,
when there are gifts. He has always said
how he wants to celebrate Christmas again and again. Until now, he was always
frozen, which is what happens when you come from skiing at Christmas.
Eric now has Christmas at home. Until now, he was
always with us with the baby, so there are no complaints, but skiing on
a lake and then Christmas.
The birth won't be such a
small thing, but when you're there,
it doesn't matter so much. That it's
great, though. That won't be so much
either. Thank you very much for all
the good wishes
and for the
gifts. The
gifts
have also
arrived
and I was
all the more
pleased because I
already have it from the
washing machine,
since you work.
Baking to calendar.
Thank you very much
for everything.
Greetings from
Eric, who is now
also here,
and from me,
and I
wish
you
all
a
merry
Christmas
and
a
happy
New
Year.
Your
Wanda.
