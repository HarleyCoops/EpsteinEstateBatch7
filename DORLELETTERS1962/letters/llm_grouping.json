The second page continues describing the apartment and asks for Knickerbocker trousers for Eric for Christmas. The third page concludes the letter with a closing from 'Dein Dale' and a postscript from 'Eric'. The content is consistent and flows logically across the three pages."

The second page continues the description of setting up the new home. The third page concludes with Christmas wishes and is signed 'Eure Wanda'. The OCR quality is poor, but the date, location, topic (moving to Banff, Christmas), and names are consistent."

The second page continues mid-sentence, describing a child's behavior (likely Andri's) and ends with a closing from 'Dein Onkel'. The content seems to flow, but the OCR quality is poor, making the connection less certain. The names 'Eric, Jale, Andri und Christopher' on the card are likely the family of the sender."

It is treated as a separate, single-page item."
