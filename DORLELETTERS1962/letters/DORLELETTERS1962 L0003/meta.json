  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reason": "A three-page letter from 'Dale' and 'Eric' to 'Mutti' dated 'Vancouver, Nov. 15/62'. The first page discusses pregnancy, a baby bed, and a new apartment in Banff. The second page continues describing the apartment and asks for Knickerbocker trousers for Eric for Christmas. The third page concludes the letter with a closing from 'Dein Dale' and a postscript from 'Eric'. The content is consistent and flows logically across the three pages."
