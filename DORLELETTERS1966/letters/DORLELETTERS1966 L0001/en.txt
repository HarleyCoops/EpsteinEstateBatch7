Dear Mom,

I wish you all a very merry Christmas, and hopefully you can already celebrate it in the new house. We are also very much looking forward to Christmas; André especially can hardly wait and is constantly tidying up, just in case Christmas arrives suddenly. He has great respect for the "tidying-up enforcer" (that's the jumping jack clock on the wall), and he even sweeps and tidies his room quickly in the evenings. Christopher, I believe, can hardly remember last Christmas. You can all read about our life here in the report. Kim already has two big teeth, both coming in at the same time, and the top ones are already peeking through as well. She is much more delicate than the boys were. For the first time since I've been here, I'm not getting all my housework and hobbies done. I guess there really is a difference between having three children and two, even though you always think one more doesn't make much of a difference. So this year I've given up on crafts altogether. I ordered presents for all of you from Quelle; hopefully they will arrive on time. For you, there's the knife and scissor sharpener, which isn't a very personal gift, I know, but I thought you could really use it. Besides that, I finally developed the pictures from 15 years ago, and the album is completely full. For Dad, there's the sweater, but I was just looking through the Quelle catalog, and I simply can't knit. I've forgotten what I ordered for Christel and Ursel. You'll probably be able to tell right away what was for whom. There would be so much to write, but tonight I still have to send off all the letters, so more after Christmas. Thank you very much for your last letter; we are very excited about the packages. I ordered the globe, but it probably won't arrive in time for Christmas.
Very warm Christmas greetings, Your Jork + Erie
