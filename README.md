# Epstein Estate Batch 7: House Oversight Committee Documents

## 🔴 LIVE: Auto-Processing and Publishing

**This repository is processing itself and publishing findings in real-time.**

As House Oversight Committee documents are analyzed, images are processed, text is extracted, and connections are revealed. The system automatically commits and publishes updates every 5 minutes with detailed summaries of the latest findings.

**Last Update:** {LAST_GIT_COMMIT_TIME}  
**Update Frequency:** Every 5 minutes  
**Status:** Processing continues as long as API credits are available

## How This Works

### Automated Document Processing Pipeline

This repository contains an automated system that processes thousands of House Oversight Committee documents using AI-powered analysis:

1. **Image Processing** - OCR extraction, visual analysis, and structured data extraction from document images
2. **Text Processing** - Content extraction, context understanding, and narrative assembly from text files  
3. **Excel/Spreadsheet Analysis** - Structure analysis, entity extraction, and relationship mapping from native files

### Real-Time Publishing

Every 5 minutes, the system:

- ✅ Analyzes new and modified files
- ✅ Extracts key findings (people, dates, relationships, notable documents)
- ✅ Highlights mentions of key figures (especially Trump and other central characters)
- ✅ Generates detailed commit messages summarizing discoveries
- ✅ Automatically commits and pushes updates to this public repository

### Live Summary Feed

The main README in [`BATCH7/README.md`](./BATCH7/README.md) acts like a **sports board news ticker**, updating every 5 minutes with:

- Latest processing status
- Key findings and discoveries
- Notable documents identified
- Character mentions and connections
- Summary statistics

Check the commit history to see the live feed of discoveries as they happen.
