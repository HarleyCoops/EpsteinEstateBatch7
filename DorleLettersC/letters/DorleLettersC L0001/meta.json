  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reason": "Letter starts with 'Toronto, den 11. Nov.' and 'Liebe Mutti!'. The content flows from political concerns about Europe, to Ursel's health, to news about Inge and Klaus returning, and finally a plan to visit New York. The closing 'Herzlichen Gruß Inge' on the last page fits, although the sender's name is Inge, while the content seems to be from the usual writer (Dolfi/Jork?). This is a slight ambiguity."
