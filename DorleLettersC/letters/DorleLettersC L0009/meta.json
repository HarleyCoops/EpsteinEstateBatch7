  "reason": "Letter starts with 'Toróls den 21. Juni' (likely Toronto) and 'Liebe Mutter!'. The first page mentions various group activities, including the 'Jolanthe' play. The second page continues seamlessly, describing a new 'Volkstanzgruppe' and an international folk festival. The third page continues describing the festival and mentions needing the guitar, linking back to other letters. The content flow is very strong."
