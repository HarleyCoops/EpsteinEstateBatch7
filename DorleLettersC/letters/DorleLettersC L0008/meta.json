  "reason": "Letter starts with 'Toronto, den 2. Mai 57' and 'Liebe Mutter!', wishing her a happy 51st birthday. The second page continues the theme of spring/Easter and asks for the guitar to be sent with Inge and Klaus. The third page discusses VW service, prices in Canada, and asks a series of family questions, fitting for a letter home. It ends with a closing from 'Karl'."
