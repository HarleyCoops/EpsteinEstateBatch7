  "reason": "Letter starts with 'Toronto, den 14. Aug. 57' and 'Liebe Mutti!'. The first page discusses plans to come home for Christmas and a recent trip. The second page discusses family matters (Christel's and Dagmar's exams) and the author's job at the bank. The third page continues the topic of the 'Jolanthe' play in Hamilton and a love for the American West, which connects to the travel theme from page one."
