  "reason": "Letter starts with 'Toronto, Dez. 27, 56' and 'Liebe Mutter!'. It begins by thanking for a Christmas package including records. The second page mentions receiving a record from 'Gisel' for birthday and Christmas. The third page mentions a Beethoven record and asks about 'meine Gitarre', which connects to other letters. The flow is somewhat disjointed but the topics are consistent."
