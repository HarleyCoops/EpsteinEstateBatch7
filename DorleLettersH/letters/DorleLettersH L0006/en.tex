\noindent
They can't come like we can, that is,
not financially. Dad once had 3 companies,
clothing factories in Germany, one of
which Inge built up all by herself and brought
into full swing. Their mother has been
dead for 18 years, so the two of them were
in the little church for a long time.
I think it's wonderful that you want to
sing again. It's possible that you will receive
another package from Photo-Porst at my
address; please send it back to Photo-
Porst. It is a Leica for one of
our boys, but the fellow waited so long
that it was too late.
Last Sunday we took a few good
pictures, which we have sent in to a
competition.

Well, that's enough for today.
Warmest greetings
to all of you,
Carl
