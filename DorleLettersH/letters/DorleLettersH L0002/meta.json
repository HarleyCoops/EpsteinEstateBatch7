  "reason": "This letter from 'Dorle' is dated Dec. 27. It forms a coherent narrative starting with thanks for Christmas gifts, listing books received, mentioning 'mecki's' account of Christmas, discussing a performance of 'Messias', and then reflecting on a lost camera and past hardships. The closing 'Herzlichen Gruß Dorle' on the final page confirms the sender. The content flows logically from one page to the next."
