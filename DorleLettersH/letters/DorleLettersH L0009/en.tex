wish them a happy New Year, I can't possibly write to everyone now.
The mail to the rest of the relatives is gone. If you still write to Dagmar,
include a greeting from me; I don't have an address for her.
I'll write to her for her birthday, will she be with you again then?
Imagine, the first of your packages arrived today,
that was really fast.
So, now I really must stop, I could go on like this forever.
Your Mutti
