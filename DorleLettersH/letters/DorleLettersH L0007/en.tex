\noindent
I'm not really sure if they'll be suitable.
The postage is for Christel and Bärbel;
they are all common expressions.
The rules of the game are as follows: The
answer cards are distributed evenly
and placed with the English answer
facing up. One person takes the
question cards and reads them aloud one
by one. Whoever thinks they have the right
answer reads it out, and then the
numbers can be compared. The whole thing is
an invention of mine; you can also
play it however you want. The toilet paper roll
is an idea we got during the holidays.
So, now I wish you all once
again all the best for Christmas
and happy holidays.
Warm Christmas greetings
from Orli.
