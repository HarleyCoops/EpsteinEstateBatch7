VIII

wishing you a good New Year, I can now write to just about everyone.
The mail to the rest of the relatives is off. If Dagmar
is still writing, she should add a greeting from me; I don't have an address
for her. I'll write to her for her birthday, is she back with you again?
Imagine, the first of your packages arrived today,
that was really fast.
So, now I really must stop, I could go on like this forever.

Your Mom
