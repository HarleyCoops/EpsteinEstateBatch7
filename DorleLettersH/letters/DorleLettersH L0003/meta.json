  "reason": "This letter from 'Mech' is dated Dec. 9th and 15th, 54. It's a long letter detailing her experiences. It starts with Christmas wishes, describes homesickness and daily routines, mentions the 'Schallplattenclub' and Christmas preparations. The page numbers VI and VII help establish the order. The final page, signed by 'Mech' and dated Dec. 15th, clearly concludes the letter by adding a note about developing pictures."
