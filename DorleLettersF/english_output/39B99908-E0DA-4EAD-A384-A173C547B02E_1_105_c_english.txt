Yes, a bath was taken at eleven, at approx. 38°C. They also bathed, it is wonderful, but at night one is so exhausted that one would like to sleep in the bath; it is, by the way, the opposite of a means to lose weight.
July 2nd. The weather is hardly worse than this morning, but we are driving away to Lake Louise. (80 miles) The drive is wonderful, now for once a few high peaks are stuck in the clouds. Then at Lake Louise we park our car, it is quite cold, then we walk along the lake, through the forest and always higher up, sometimes over cliffs, sometimes over stones up to the Bing Glacier. The sight even in the ice field, I like that so much, do you still remember Bishop Ping? It is just somehow different on foot, one is much more into the mountains up there. I believe it also made a tremendous impression on almost everyone these days, regarding which he also didn't seem to have much respect, for he merrily scrambles up a crumbling slate wall with sandals, not entirely free from vertigo. In the small tea house we drank a cup of tea. After approx. 2 hours we arrive back at our car, and we immediately look for a campsite, in a small forest clearing not far from the Hotel Chateau Louise.
