Already a lot. But since all gas stations and shops were closed, it unfortunately fell through.
Evenings in Edmonton. The preparations and the futile effort for the money gift had been in vain, because Siggi's friend went to Flin-Flon (Honeymoon) yesterday. Siggi is disappointed and in a bad mood, which I don't blame him for. We are wondering if the money and time will suffice until Vancouver. Since both are almost completely used up, it's too risky for us; furthermore, we wouldn't be able to stay anywhere then, and that's worthless. It's better to really see the area of the National Park between Calgary, Banff, and Jasper. So, tomorrow morning we're driving to Calgary, where Siggi has another friend. - Edmonton is also located on the North Saskatchewan River, and although the surrounding area is partly flat, the city is built uphill on both sides of the river, which always looks nice. Edmonton is the fastest-growing city in Canada, and is the gateway to Northern Canada, which is why it unfortunately also attracts all sorts of undesirable people. These are largely still gold panners from Alaska who cannot work in winter, or other adventurers. Of course, the entire city doesn't consist of these.
