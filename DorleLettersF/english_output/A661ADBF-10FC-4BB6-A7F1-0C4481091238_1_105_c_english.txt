Mosquitoes. We are staying overnight again.
On July 4th, when we left Saskatoon this morning, it was quite cool; we are also already quite far north. Until the North Saskatchewan River, where we bathe and have breakfast, the weather is beautiful again. At the spot where I washed, there lay a dead calf, hide and all, ugh, darn it! We then set off at 8 o'clock; then in the mornings, it was always aching legs from sleeping, because the roads are bad here again, and most of the time I hit the worst spots. At 12 o'clock in Lloydminster, this wheel was again dealt with for the third time. It still looks intact; now it should last a long time, even though it’s good. – We are soon in Edmonton, so it was said. A friend lives there, with whom he already worked together in Germany. Since we haven't properly washed ourselves with truly fresh water for days now, we are now looking for a lake. The lakes indicated on the map were all in swampy areas. So we drive 23 miles before Edmonton into Elk Island Park. We just wanted to eat at a picnic spot, which was completely empty, but since it hadn't rained, and there was no talk of an early start, we'll sleep soon.
