like a forest, but thankfully, where you can canoe, and most importantly, that in 2 hours by car you are in the middle of the mountains. What applies to Germany and Northern Germany is, in Canada, Manitoba and Saskatchewan & (rarely just driven through once) and Southern Germany corresponds to Alberta and B.C.

Right behind Calgary you can already see the snow-covered mountains, I think I know what that felt like for me. The lakes and the foothills begin immediately too. At the park entrance 5 miles before Banff you are already surrounded by magnificent mountains. - In Banff, we first visited the Museum of the Rockies and got some brochures about the area. (Here you can also rent mountain guides, isn't that something?) - We had our lunches at a very secluded spot at Lake Minnewanka, which is just as lonely and quiet as in the Alps. It usually lies around on the ground towards the end of July, which for me as an experienced Rad. concerning the Er.

Here is also one of the 2 hot sulfur springs, with approx. 44°C, it smells like a chemistry lab and the rocks around them are yellow. Already below Banff
