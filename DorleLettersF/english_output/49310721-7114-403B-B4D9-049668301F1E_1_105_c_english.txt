Trois-Rivières, Quebec, 5.7.55

Dear folks,
Just a quick note, before it gets dark. Now our second holiday day is already over, which means Wiland had to drive on Tuesday. Inge’s old friend and I wanted to be back at Robben’s home right away. She, or technical drawing, has something going on in Toronto. By 4 PM she was in bed. Then for so long, and give me time, that such a brewery gets [it]. Otherwise no city [visible] over the water. We then again for a while from Quebec. That was already new territory then up to the eastern end of Lake Ontario, the Thousand Islands, and large beautiful cities, and along the St. Lawrence River which is narrow there. The small ones near Kingston were, of course. But I drove to the shore onto a mowed meadow and first went swimming again in the river, as plans were underway. For a long time, he still wanted Chicago. We still had potato salad and sandwiches, then we played until we were surprised by a thunderstorm. It was very beautiful.
