which they cannot judge at all yet,
that Dorte will thus be given a brave haven.
Actually, it's really none of my business to interfere here, but I'm doing it just this once; but I feel sorry for Dorte, because she is very attached to you, dear Mrs. Hofmann, and to her sisters – and what if she can't show it!
I don't want to keep you any longer now and will therefore conclude. You can be proud of Dorte; I don't know a single girl who has conducted herself so bravely and properly abroad alone – like Dorte.
Please excuse this letter; it is not meant to upset you. I am very fond of Dorte and want to help her.
Sincerely,
I am your Inge Kordewitsch.
