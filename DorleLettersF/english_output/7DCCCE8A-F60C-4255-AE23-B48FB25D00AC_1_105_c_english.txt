Dear much-esteemed Mrs. Hofmann,

You are certainly a little surprised that I am writing to you. You probably know me at most from stories as Dorle's friend – and it is as such that I am writing to you.

Lately, Dorle has been very distressed because she feels that she is becoming more and more estranged from home. And since I understand this very, very well, even though she would certainly never say anything, I wanted to write to you. Do not lose your trust in Dorle; although she is a very reserved and difficult person, she is sincere, selfless, clean, and very capable. I would absolutely vouch for her.

I am always afraid that Hecki, who is still very young and away from home for the very first time, judges things too quickly,
