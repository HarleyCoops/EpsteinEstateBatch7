At Biel, deep in Sellaunn. I’m now glad that you reminded Mother about the spade, because it was badly needed for the dogs. In my diary I wrote: Must

First scold Sellaunn a bit so nothing splashes, then put stones under the wheels; that provides a firm surface. Meaning: I didn't even have a tow rope with me; that almost left me speechless. If I had asked before the trip if he had a rope, he surely would have said I shouldn't interfere in everything – Well, the main thing is that we get out again, though ready for a bath. Even here you can only swim at a designated sandy beach; in other places, it's too marshy. As good as the wash was, there were so many creatures, because when we came out of the water, about 5-6 leeches were hanging on our legs, which were hard to get off. That really sent me to Biel, and I had already been looking forward to the lakes in Ontario.
Now we're heading, somewhat resigned (me, us?), towards Polen-hosen to the estate, to grease up and have a smoke.
