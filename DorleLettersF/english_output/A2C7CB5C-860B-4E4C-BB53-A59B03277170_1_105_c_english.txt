It was a magnificent spectacle of colors and wind on the water. The boat struggled a few times, only dragging its anchor, and without any lightning, we covered 35 miles of water. Despite that, it was a warm 35 degrees at night; we had the car open and were just lying in our pajamas in sleeping bags. You can perhaps imagine that we felt the need to stretch our legs at 5 AM, even though we had both slept well. So I slipped out of the sleeping bag, Inge was still in the back, and we drove on like that until just before Montreal. There we bathed, freshened up, and ate the rest of the potato salad. Then we went to Montreal. Right from the border, one noticed a difference. All traffic signs were dense, we didn't follow the traffic rules as strictly, and the people speak French and are bilingual, just as German and English are school languages. The people are not as polite as in Ontario; they are more direct. Montreal itself is beautiful, plus, completely different from Toronto; it gives a much more European impression. Churches are on every corner, very nice ones with beautiful altars, and above all St. Joseph's Oratory is magnificently designed. It's in the middle of the city and on a mountain. So I'll send you pictures as soon as I have time. Have I already written that we have a bottle-can opener? Warm regards, Doris.
