Spadima Rol is driving. Everything is fine except for:
leaking gasoline to be dealt with. (Riffprisch swings) Nozzle without
a trigger, not quite perfect cooking. The rest will
become apparent with time. Since I've already been running around quite a bit today,
I'll soon fall asleep, my head
on Siegf's lap, and when I wake up, they are refueling for the
first time in grey art; the gasoline here already costs
44 ¢/gallon. I immediately fall back asleep, because my stomach feels
like a stone.
July 1st. It's only 5:15 AM and I'm already getting up.
(So now we've had dinner; I had potato
and bean salad, both with a lot of onion, and I had
made it, and for dessert, 1 peach, which I was given by the
hospital. To drink, there's only water.
(today, tomorrow, and in the evenings.) Now back to the di-
ary.
We are in Cobalt on Lake Timiskaming; we will
have a great breakfast (Pumpernickel, sausage, tomatoes,
onions, and mustard; I eat a lot of the latter) and then we're
on our way. The lake closely resembles Lake Constance. - Now I may
drive; Siegf. is already feasting (damn it!), but
it's great driving, otherwise I probably wouldn't have
slept so well.
After 6½ hours of driving (375 km) on bad roads,
which, however, do not take the highway, in the morning
