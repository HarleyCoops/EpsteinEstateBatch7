Pensions, but already on Main Street we saw them, that I wouldn't have liked to spend the night there. By the way, Hugh's friend tells us later, many people go in the summer to northern Canada or Alaska to sawmills or gold panning operations. One can even go up privately and try their luck with it, though then 2/3 goes to the government. In winter they then come to Edmonton and usually spend all their money again, because after half a year of this monotonous life they want to live well again. But some also go up because of the lovely landscape, which is said to be unique. —
July 5th. In pouring rain and with a bad weather forecast, I woke up with a stomachache. The drive to Calgary is monotonous; I slept. Then we first looked for the friend's apartment. The streets are divided by numbers and cardinal directions, so that it's easy to find your way; for example, the friend lives at 2126 25A Street SW. We'll then grease the car, and do an oil change. Calgary immediately makes a good impression, especially clean. One sees many well-maintained houses everywhere, and nice cowboys. Someone brings the car freshly washed out of the garage. But the rest is all secondary, because he loves his Clef more than anything else.
