Toronto, July 20, '55.

Dear Mother!

You are surely all waiting for a detailed report of my trip, well, now it's finally coming. Briefly in advance, it was great, I saw so much of Canada that I now have a completely different impression of it. But I want to tell everything nicely in order. If I get carried away again, it's because I have too much to tell and want to write everything at once.
So on Tuesday, June 20, I bought a Vito B, oh, you already knew that, then groceries for the first few days. At Braunmühle I still had to pick up photos, bathe, pack, eat etc., so we started punctually at 10 o'clock. I still got help making sandwiches, by the way, she did end up leaving with Inge, but she will tell you about that herself. - Now I'm writing to you from my diary, because that's my daily bread, I wrote every day, often while driving, after cooking, before going to bed, or elsewhere.
June 30. 10:15 PM. Think how we are 53
