Then they live in the middle of the street in bear caps, playing with their young boys. Photographing feeding is strictly forbidden, because the bears don't get enough and then smash the windows. As soon as you open a door or window, they come here.

Now I am sitting on a stone on the bank of the Alaska streams and rivers, anxiously waiting for an eagle shed. They look practical but also more impractical. A smaller one, for convenience, as close as possible to the riverbank for eating, after driving. He certainly feels he has started on it (he says!), but as if from the ground up, he succeeded in getting a lot. Although he had no stone with him and in front, the first one sank deeper and deeper. Since he is too lazy to attract anyone, he went there for a while. When it didn't attract on its own, when a car pulled up in reverse with 6 men sitting and he didn't arrive, nothing else remained but to wait for an eagle shed.

Meanwhile, they have now come around, thank God. He needs to attract many things. If he has nothing on him, he should dare a lot. And above all, if you already make such an impression, you must not be too cowardly, yes, too cowardly, more than he allows.
