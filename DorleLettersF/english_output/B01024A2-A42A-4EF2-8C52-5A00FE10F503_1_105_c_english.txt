did not function properly anymore, he thoroughly cursed me out, saying I had driven it to ruin, but he has now learned from professional expertise that it could be from all the water we drove through. It was also perfectly fine again the next day.

July 13th. We were still sitting at Regina's yesterday evening, however, in a bad mood. The Jeep's clutch was repaired, but the brakes and the poor road conditions were not resolved. But all that should then be fine, so that we would rather manage the 135 miles without a workshop, because with the rain, the road there will also have been worse. - Today we have already driven for 6 hours again, a hellish schedule that makes everything feel overwhelming. In Winnipeg we had the car inspected, had nothing overhauled. And after that, the steering starts to wobble terribly when one operates the steering. And since it costs approx. 40 dollars, he thinks that it's not much. Frankly, people are very willing (to pay), but I'm not keen on it. We are staying overnight in Kenora.
