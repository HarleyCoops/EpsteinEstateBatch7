It was a nice spot, until suddenly a large, wet, brown bear trotted by. That was too much for us, and we looked for another picnic spot. We then found spots everywhere, but it was nicer. There are three covered spots with 6 tables and a beautiful viewpoint, from where you can go hiking, etc. It's a good place to shelter well from the rain. And in the evenings, it's quite cool outside, not like here, where it's still 38°C in the evenings. – That evening, we also had a barbecue, and that was good too. It smells as if beef lightly at sun car company, no more. Now it also realizes that it's good if we don't buy bananas for €45 / 100, etc. July 8. Now it's gotten quite late, because I couldn't get up earlier, because I had such stomach pains all night like never before, it was great. It's raining a little, we're driving to Jasper today. At the Columbia Glacier, we wanted to consider whether we should drive up, but the weather wasn't good enough for us. The mountains are quite high, up to 3800 m with a lot of snow and glaciers. Krug
