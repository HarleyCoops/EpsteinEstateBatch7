  "reason": "A two-page letter dated June 21, 1955, from Toronto. The first page starts with a salutation to 'Frau Hofmann' and the second page contains the closing and signature 'Inge Korlenbecker'. The text flows perfectly from the first page to the second, discussing a mutual acquaintance named Dorle."
