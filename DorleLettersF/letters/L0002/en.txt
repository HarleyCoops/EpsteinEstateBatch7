Toronto, June 21, 1955
189 Robert Street.

Dear Mrs. Hofmann,

You are surely a little surprised that I am writing to you. You know me at most from stories as Dorle's friend—and it is as such that I am writing to you now.

Dorle has been very down lately because she feels that she is becoming more and more estranged from home. And since I sense this very strongly, although she would certainly never say anything, I wanted to write to you. Please do not question your trust in Dorle; while she is a very reserved and difficult person, she is sincere, selfless, upstanding, and very capable. I would absolutely stake my life on her.

I always fear that Mecki, who is still very young and away from home for the first time, is too quick to judge things she cannot yet understand, and that Dorle is being done a bit of an injustice as a result.
Really, it is not my place to interfere here, and I am only doing it this one time; but I feel sorry for Dorle, because she is very attached to you, dear Mrs. Hofmann, and to her sisters—even if she cannot show it!

I don't want to take up any more of your time, so I will close. You can be proud of Dorle; I don't know a single girl who has managed so bravely and honorably on her own in a foreign country—like Dorle has.

Please forgive me for this letter; it is not meant to upset you. I am just very fond of Dorle and want to help her.

With very kind regards,
I am yours,
Inge Korlenbecker.
