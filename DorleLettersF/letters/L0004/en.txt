Dear Mother and siblings.
Second day of vacation, it is,
we are sleeping a lot, re-
freshing ourselves, swimming and lazing around,
mornings and evenings. Today our
skin got a bit more sun
in the car, walking and driving to
Saint Joseph's Oratory in Montreal, it is wonderful,
similar to Gard in France, monthly
83749 cripples are healed, would like
to have sent cards. again already
orde.
