Trois-Rivières, Quebec, 7/5/55

Dear Aunt L.,
Just a quick letter before it gets dark. Our second day of vacation is already over—that is, I've been on vacation since Friday, but on Friday, Inge's mother and Sister M. left, and I wanted them to have plenty of time with their fiancés. So we set off from Toronto on Monday. We went swimming at midday and in the evening tried out the air mattresses, which you can get very cheaply at the special sales. Nothing else special happened, except that when we encountered a ship on the water—we went out again in the evening—we saw the Thousand Islands, which stretch from the Quebec border, new territory for us, all the way to the beginning of Lake Ontario. We also saw a large, beautiful bridge to the States, and the St. Lawrence River, which is very busy with steamers there and makes the Rhine from Bingen to Mainz look small, of course. In the evening, we drove to the riverbank onto a mown meadow and first went for another swim in the river in front of us. We got hungry then, as we still wanted to go to Chicago. We had potato salad and anchovies, then we played a game of Twenty-One before a thunderstorm, which rolled in very spookily. It was a magnificent spectacle of colors and wind on the water; the ship was dragged by its anchor a few times. Then it was so warm at night that we had the car doors and windows open and just lay in our sleeping bags in our pajamas.
You can probably imagine that by 5 o'clock in the morning we felt the need to stretch our legs, even though we had both slept well. So I slipped out of my sleeping bag while Inge was still lying in the back. We started driving and went until just before Montreal. There we went for a swim, washed up, and finished the rest of the apple salad. Then it was on to Montreal. You could notice a difference right from the border. All the traffic signs were different from over there, the traffic rules weren't as strict, and the people speak French and English—French as a dialect, English as the language taught in school. The people aren't as polite as in Ontario; they're more laid-back. Montreal itself is beautiful, but completely different from Toronto; it makes a much more European impression. There are churches on every corner, very nice ones with beautiful altars, and St. Joseph's Oratory in particular is magnificently situated, right in the middle of the city on the mountain. I will send you pictures. Has she already written that she took a drawing course?
Warmest regards,
Your
