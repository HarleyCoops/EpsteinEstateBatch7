  "reason": "A two-page letter dated July 5, 1955, from Quebec. The first page begins 'Liebe Tante L.' and describes a trip with 'Inge'. The second page continues the narrative about the trip to Montreal and concludes with the closing 'Herzlichen Gruß Euer'. The content is consistent and flows logically between the pages."
