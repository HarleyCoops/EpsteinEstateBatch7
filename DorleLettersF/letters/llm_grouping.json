      "reason": "This is a long letter dated July 20, 1955, addressed to 'Liebe Mutter'. The author explicitly states they are transcribing from their travel diary. The subsequent pages are diary entries with dates from June 30th to July 16th and/or Roman numerals (II-XI), detailing a cross-Canada trip. The content flows chronologically. There are two pages numbered 'XI', which seem to be distinct parts of the diary. The final page provides a closing summary and mentions the author's address."

The text flows perfectly from the first page to the second, discussing a mutual acquaintance named Dorle."

      "reason": "This is a single, fragmented page. It begins with a salutation 'Liebe Mutter und Geschwister' and mentions a trip to Montreal and St. Josef's Oratorium, a topic also covered in letter L0003. However, the salutation is different, and the handwriting style or content doesn't definitively link it to any other page. It is treated as a separate, incomplete letter."
