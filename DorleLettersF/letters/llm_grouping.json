      "reason": "This is a long travelogue addressed to 'Liebe Mutter' dated July 20, 1955. The pages are ordered chronologically based on the diary entries (June 30th to July 16th) and Roman numeral page markers (II-XI). The narrative is consistent, describing a road trip across Canada. Some pages lack clear markers but fit logically within the timeline. The final page provides a closing summary and return address."

      "reason": "This is a single, short, fragmented page addressed to 'Liebe Mutter und Geschwister'. It mentions the second day of a vacation and a visit to St. Josef's Oratorium in Montreal. It could potentially be part of L0003, which also discusses a trip to Montreal, but the salutation is different ('Tante L' vs. 'Mutter und Geschwister'). Due to this conflict, it is grouped as a separate, incomplete letter."
