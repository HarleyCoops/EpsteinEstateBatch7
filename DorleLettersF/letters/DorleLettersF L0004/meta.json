  "reason": "This is a single, short, fragmented page addressed to 'Liebe Mutter und Geschwister'. It mentions the second day of a vacation and a visit to St. Josef's Oratorium in Montreal. It could potentially be part of L0003, which also discusses a trip to Montreal, but the salutation is different ('Tante L' vs. 'Mutter und Geschwister'). Due to this conflict, it is grouped as a separate, incomplete letter."
