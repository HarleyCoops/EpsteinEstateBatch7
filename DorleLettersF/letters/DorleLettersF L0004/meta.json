  "reason": "This is a single, fragmented page. It begins with a salutation 'Liebe Mutter und Geschwister' and mentions a trip to Montreal and St. Josef's Oratorium, a topic also covered in letter L0003. However, the salutation is different, and the handwriting style or content doesn't definitively link it to any other page. It is treated as a separate, incomplete letter."
