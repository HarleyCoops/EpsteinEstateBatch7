Dear Mother and siblings.
It's the second day of our vacation, we're sleeping a lot, refreshing ourselves, swimming, and lazing around, morning and evening. Today our skin got a bit more sun in the car, we're going to see Saint Joseph's Oratory in Montreal, it's wonderful, similar to Gard in France, monthly 83749 cripples are healed, would like to have sent cards. again already.
