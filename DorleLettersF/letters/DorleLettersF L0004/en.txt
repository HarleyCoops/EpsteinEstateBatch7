Dear Mother and siblings.
It's the second day of our vacation,
we're sleeping a lot, re-
freshing ourselves, swimming, and lazing around,
mornings and evenings. Today our
skin got a bit more sun
in the car, walking and driving.
Joseph's Oratory in Montreal, it is wonderful,
similar to Gard in France, monthly
83749 cripples are healed, would like
cards sent. again already
orde.
