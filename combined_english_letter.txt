Hofheim, 22.11.
Dear Mech.!
Thank you very much for your
letter. When will you finally
send me the pictures from
Säntis? I have been waiting for
half a year for them. Can you
write me your Christmas wishes?
Preferably before the
1st of Advent. Because then I'm doing
major shopping in Frankfurt.
What are you giving the
various relatives? Are Giesel.
and Mr. Geser already gone?
Where are they going?

Hours at the America House.
It was nice. But I noticed
that I have forgotten many
words. Tomorrow
evening I'm going to a
singing group, also for the 1st time.
Best regards!

Dear Mother!
How are you? I want to
briefly write to you about the apple
prices at the wholesale market in
Frankfurt. We sold Cox apples
for 48 and 50 Pf per pound
to small retailers, and
there are still wormy ones among them.
The large one is, however, very
beautiful. Golden Delicious apples are selling
slowly, 25 Pf, but some
are worse than A. There are also
some for 32 Pf. Boskoops cost only
20 to 25 Pf, but they are not
particularly beautiful. We are not selling
any Boskoops yet. In Frankfurt
in the store, Cox apples are sold
for 70 Pf.

Dear Mother, I just received
your letter. And your
vacation is very certain,
because Babettche, our house-
keeper is leaving on Dec. 1st. So
there will probably be no one
here for the house again. We'll see if
it can still be arranged.
Everyone here advises me against putting money
in the savings bank because
it is very likely there will be inflation.
Now on Dec. 3rd in Frankfurt
I'm going on a big shopping trip. I need under-
wear, pajamas. Then I want
to buy myself a dress for
Sundays. I think that will be
cheaper than having one made.
Then I still need 1 or 2
pairs of work pants, a smock apron,
and a good fabric jacket. I am very satis-
fied with the coat. I am currently knitting
a sweater for myself, but I still want

knitting. I can get all the
things in Frankfurt much
cheaper than there with you.
You know that I always
enjoy books. The
beige wool dress and your
handwoven belt is
too short for me, and also a
little too tight. Does it fit Chris-
tel? And a white
polo shirt, that is still almost
new.

What should I give
Grandma?

Best regards,
Dorli.

Apple prices are rising!
and it is generally expected tha-
t, that apples in sprin-
g will become expensive. There are
also no foreign apples on
the market. Inferior
goods are plentiful. Lake
Constance fruit stands out very
favorably, here on the market
and is gladly bought.
Here in the newspaper, they are
looking for a permanent mai-
d for household and
agriculture for France. I
have now written for more
details. I also
recently got an address
through the radio.
