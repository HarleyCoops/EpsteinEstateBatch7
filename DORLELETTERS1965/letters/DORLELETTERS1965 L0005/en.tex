Bauff, May 18/65

Dear Mom!

Thank you so very much for the generous birthday package and the letter. I was so happy that it was all so generous, I wasn't expecting it.
I've looked through the things, the laundry is so clean that the short trousers are hardly usable anymore, because you can't really patch them much now, and then it's a shame to waste the effort. I'm now going to patch an old dress and insert a piece from it, if the work is worth it. I did think, however, that it was a stiff dress, but there's a lot of work involved, and I also have a belt that can be used to widen the dress on the front and other part. I've already sewn it on.
I had to make patterns now, because I didn't have a pattern, and now I have the pattern for the dress and I've enlarged it, to my measurements.
That very night I cut out the two pieces, to my measurements, it all turned out just as I wanted. It's a very beautiful dress. The color suits me very well. I don't want to try it on just yet, because I haven't ironed it. It's a very beautiful dress, and everything is so precise that it's a custom-made job.
I've cut out the two front and back pieces, and I've also already cut the aluminum paper. It all worked out wonderfully, I've also already cut out the two front pieces, and the two back pieces as well. Now I have cut out the two front pieces, and the two back pieces as well.
