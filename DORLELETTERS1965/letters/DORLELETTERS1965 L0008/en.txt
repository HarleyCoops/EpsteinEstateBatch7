Bruff, Aug. 14/65

Dear Mom,
So, nothing will come of the move on September 1st! We are very
sorry, but if she gets a permanent position, then it will
probably be worth it. It starts on September 1st & as a supervisor
at a new school, so she might have a good
position, because the man is north of Vancouver. One
of many school principals and $6000 dollars a year, as far
as I know. Now he is not disturbed. But now it means waiting
again, until there isn't much to see there yet, because we renovated right
when we moved into our house. A house, a room that looks so wonderful,
that is truly our pride and joy. Besides that, we have
at least an extendable table, which we were able to build and varnish
in the basement. Please, tell them at your place if she could perhaps
put a note with you, and a request for me, if you still
have the boxes, please write down the numbers that are on
them for me. And please Color II (110-125/240 V)
The battery, which is very bad, has the number R3716
(4-4-59) Sonnerochein). The device is a
Unith-blitz Fabrik No. 8580. These are all numbers that are on
it, but maybe not with the factory number, but on
there. It's not a big deal, but it would probably be useful.
Warmest greetings to all of you, your son
and daughter-in-law, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
