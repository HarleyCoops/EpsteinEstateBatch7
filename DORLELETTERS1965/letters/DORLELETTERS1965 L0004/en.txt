Banff, Feb. 16, 65

Dear Walter,

Thank you for your two letters. André gave us the whole block of stationery, so I thought I should use it right away to get this province. André is very enthusiastic about his new school in Calgary. He has no other excitement; the exam is so difficult that one hardly has time and should probably not expect much for oneself, which, however, makes his work very substantial. For two winter months, André, Olaf and their families are snowshoers, but now that's pretty much been a work stoppage. Eric is working for his boss in Calgary, which would probably be 180 km there and back every day, so when the time for studying and the weekend comes, he's a bit tired. Every day I go sledding with my Christophers. One time I preferred to go down the mountain alone, under his umbrellas. The house is almost uninhabited; when people find out, everyone wants it. We have so much junk, a real cluttered-up shed, from the house. In the end we had one, which is now in the Rockies, one of the biggest of its kind. One time an Alberta is completely ruined, it is Norway and Sweden, now they can't do it without fault. Olaf, Eric a 4-year apprenticeship per forma pauperis, but then they allowed everything, Olaf's first, second and third for about 6 weeks for snowshoeing support and for going up into the mountains, and I was alone now in the winter for mountaineering, besides doing homework in the barracks. There are still houses over there. I have now found an apartment with the little ones for an hour, and the walk will stay that long and we'll do something, but not so that they get too much air. Sealed airtight, all windows, and you haven't opened the front door in a long time. For a while, around the house up to halfway is the approach for a kind of warm cave that they make inside in the course of a day, because besides looking a bit bright without a curtain, it also stays warm all day when the sun shines. The glass alone, however, makes it a few degrees colder. One day was a super sunny day for us, all day, but it stayed behind the window box and in it, it drips down with plastic and so on. We have a small stove like an Ognica, and with that we have some floor. The second box and drawer are, of course we also had no tools. It would all be much easier if we had tools. We have to finish the room with the bed, but then we would see it with the dark stained horn. The living room now makes the balcony and also on the side, one also sees the horn on the stones we built a wall for. Also for the cress to sow. You must have to do that soon too. The brothers had to, even if hopefully the horn's construction goes district, that it's progress to buy a few Orndeln for and achieve. All sorts of things, maybe buy and on the property. You can get well-kept houses from Brandt for the price of the "house" if Brandt for expansion or renovation. You get the permit by return mail after you've sent in your self-drawn plan for $5.-, and then you have to stick the permit on the outside of the addition. It's with the doctor within ten days. You have to follow the rules correctly; when you're done with it, the inspector comes, once for the foundations, once for the shell, and the whole house built yourself and you're just not a contractor, but yes, it's fun when you can improve it all like that, but of course it's also work.

I'm already looking forward to when it's warm enough outside that you don't always have to dress the children. We just had a visit from friends who live in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, which is the main region of Canada where the fruit comes from. It's already green there in December, but also a lot of total loss from frost on some mornings. In April, at any rate, peaches and apricots froze, which doesn't count for apples or pears. Cherries, that hardly counts for the farmers, but it does for us, because the fruit prices would then be very high. Whether one has a fruit tree there, I don't know yet.

Best regards, Your Uncle

When you've received the pictures, could you give them to Christel? Or someone else.
