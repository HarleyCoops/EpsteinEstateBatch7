Dear Mom!

From S. Francisco came the
slippers, which came back so
quickly. Yesterday I also got
a small package with the knitted
gloves for my dear mother-in-law,
who was very happy about them.
Yesterday a letter also came
from Aunt Emi,
who also sends her greetings
and reads to him. From Aunt Emi
the children also received a
lovely little wooden horse. It was said to be
on and lost, then it had a
skill or a thigh,
that is then already very
perfect, nq, Aunt Emi now has
more than Christopher, on Sylvanas's
birthday (90th) born.
One received from Japan a
skill, free of charge, the inner side
for the emigrants. It is one
for the winter initial equipment of the Eiger
climber in summer with a wreath of
autumn fl. of the school. I only want to have
proven so much and what one
of course a beautiful Christmas-
like card with a picture of
our house in winter received.
The copy of the "Eigenheim," which
was made at some point. It
is really great and one thing was the
view of you all we could never
have made better, that was
verbena-beautiful. We cost here 8.60.
from you (240 DM)
Warmest greetings, also from Eve,
Your Dolfi
