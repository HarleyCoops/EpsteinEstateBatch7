Dear Bärbel!
Just a quick, short letter in a hurry
before Christmas. I'm writing
because I wanted to tell you all to
check the radio program here for
Dec. 21st, 22nd, or 23rd. That's when
our children's gift-giving
and celebration from the club and
church will be broadcast in Germany.
I just don't know exactly which
station; it's being recorded by
shortwave radio Montreal.
At the hospital, we dietitians are making
lots of things for the patients in our free
time, and partly during work time too.
We just made 600 snowmen
out of cotton balls, with top hats,
scarves, and red buttons. Then we have
little Christmas trees made of cardboard, stars,
and Santa Clauses.

I'm working on Christmas, which isn't
so bad, I'm used to it.
It's actually double the work then, because
half the staff has the day off. I'll have
5 days off at New Year's, so I'll get to
celebrate New Year's properly for a change.
On Christmas Eve, after
church, where I'll be singing, there will be a
cozy Christmas party for single people,
organized by the Protestant youth group.
That will surely be nice. It's right
across from us, in the church basement.
Now, say a nice hello to everyone
again. They shouldn't be mad at me
if I don't write to everyone anymore.
Liesl just received a letter,
Michi too, I thank her for her
Christmas letter. Christel hasn't written to me
in half an eternity,
and Ursel not for quite a while. No hard feelings.
I've already written to Mother, but the
pictures aren't ready yet.

Merry Christmas
