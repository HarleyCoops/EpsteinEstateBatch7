St. Catharines, Jan. 4th, '53.

Dear Vösel!

I wish you a very happy birthday. By the time this arrives, the old year will be almost the new year. It will probably arrive too early, please forgive me, but I've been out every evening the last few days. How did you spend Christmas? Ours was very good. We were working, completely in fact; at first I wanted to but often there was just no room. This time not again at church. As I've said before. I saw something wrong there once, which could have serious consequences. But I'd rather have the sugar for my legs weighed out exactly to the gram here, and we need it without complaint (?), and those with high modern or "clicks". I have for... The little Gerh from our (?) year to kindergarten every... a "kindergarten" or "village," namely that every child goes there, although only from 5-6. There also a little bit or and have a film or plan.

Are you on vacation again until Feb. 6th at work? Is the weather so bad there too? Is Uncle Hans still in Africa?

Since it's already late, I will stop for today. I wish you and everyone all the best for the new year and that your health improves.

Yours,
\end{document}
