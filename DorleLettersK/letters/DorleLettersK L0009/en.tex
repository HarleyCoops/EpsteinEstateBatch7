Brownsville, May 1st

Dear Mother!
For your birthday, I wish you all the
best, but above all to be completely healthy
and to have good help. The
professors are once again not so
great, so it's not so bad for
you. Well, perhaps
Magdalen will give you a few nice
weeks so you can get a proper rest.
The upright ones in the last
week have turned really green. The hot
cherries are also all on bushes here. I haven't
seen any standards yet. But
in a week we will be finished with the experiment,
then we'll get right to it.
Sunday is "Blossom-Tuesday," when
people from Canada and the U.S.A. drive through the
area and look at the blossoms.
In two weeks, the "Niagara Barn Theatre"
by Shathourne's will open. It is very
nice, and also very good. It is just a cellar, with a
bar and a dance hall. There are plays every evening from May
to November. A theater is
something very rare in Canada now.
Here, people go to the cinema every evening, that's enough.
