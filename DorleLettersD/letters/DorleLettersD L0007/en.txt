From far away!

Dear Mom,

For your birthday, I wish you all the best, good health, and not so many worries for the next year. Hopefully a solution can be found soon, so there isn't always so much to do there.
Are you going for a boat ride on your birthday? The weather has just received a letter from Dad, that he on Sunday to the and. that was so long ago. sent with warm greetings from Auntie. That's when I first see what a sloppy fellow I am. Well, maybe you dear sisters can forgive me. left over? Have you received my package yet? I just finished the green scarf. You're on my mind, I want Dad now for the navel with tea and a few sandwiches to come too late. The biggest one is from cotton tooth. You I love most of all.
But now I want to be very brief and thank you for your warm birthday wishes. I was very happy to receive them, and also for the lovely letter from Dad. I've already read it several times. My package will be sent off tomorrow evening. I hope you like it. I'll send you the scarf next year for your name day, so you get something from me then, too. I haven't read Auntie's letter as often yet, but I will. I was also very happy to receive it. I don't want to wear the scarf too often just yet, so it doesn't get dirty so quickly.
But now I'll keep it very brief.
