  "reason": "The letter starts with a date (Vancouver, Sept. 16, 56) and salutation to 'mechi'. It gives news about mutual friends (Siegfried, Käthe, Klaus, André). The second page continues this theme, asking about a picture of 'Heinz' and mentioning 'Inge und Klaus'. The third page describes a trip to the Okanagan Valley with 'gudrun', which is also mentioned on the second page. The final page discusses future travel plans with 'Peti' and seems to be the conclusion of the letter."
