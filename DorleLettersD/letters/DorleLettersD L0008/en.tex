\noindent
Mrs. E. Hofmann
Stetten / Meersburg
Bodensee
Germany!

Dear Folks! Just a sign of
life today from San Francisco and our trip.
The weather is beautiful, that is, right
now we are standing in Death Valley and
the oversized street,
right in the middle of the worst hustle and bustle
I have ever experienced, how much
easier to tell about it than when
isolated in the desert. Just
interesting, there will be pictures in
droves, already 3 color films
and 5 black-and-white, more in
a letter. Warmest greetings, Dorel.
