  "reason": "This letter, dated March 24th, starts with Easter wishes. The content flows logically from school ending, to birthday wishes for 'Mechi', to plans for sports with 'Eggeling', to future travel plans (Vancouver over Calgary), and concludes with a closing formula signed 'Dork'. The topics are consistent and the pages connect seamlessly."
