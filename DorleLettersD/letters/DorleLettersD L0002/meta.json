  "reason": "This letter starts with a clear date (May 1, 1956) and salutation, thanking 'Mutter' for birthday gifts. The second page continues the birthday theme, describing celebrations with the youth group. The third page is fragmented but seems to continue the theme of personal reflection and social interactions mentioned on the previous page, making it a plausible, though not certain, conclusion."
