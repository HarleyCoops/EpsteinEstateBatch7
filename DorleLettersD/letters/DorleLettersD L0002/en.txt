Toronto, May 1, '56.
Dear Mother,
Thank you so much for everything you
sent me for my birthday. The little sewing basket
was a really good idea; now my chocolate box
and my shoebox can finally go in the garbage. And with the
side pockets and the pouch inside, you
can store everything so neatly. The chess
set is also really great, especially the fact that the
pieces don't always fall all over the place. That
must also be good for the train or the bus, or
on a blanket in the grass. I handed out the chocolate
during our outing on Sunday; everyone was amazed
at how good it tastes. They sell
Swiss chocolate here too, but it's
made here, and the album came just
at the right time, since my other 4 are
full. Thanks again for everything. From Inge
I got "Des Knaben Wunderhorn" and two very
charming summer dresses. One is plaid with a white
collar and a white belt, sleeveless, with
a gathered skirt, perfect for outings and for the evening.
The other is white with little red elephants,
for more special occasions. Inge sewed them from patterns,
and they fit like a glove, without a fitting.
I've never had such a nice birthday.
The evening before was family night.
Everyone already wished me a happy birthday then, from the
congregation and the pastors and from the group, because the time changed in the evening,
and it was actually already 12 o'clock. On
Sunday morning I slept until half past nine,
and then after church at 11 o'clock, breakfast
with the boys' cars in the pouring rain
to Inge's birthday, where Inge and Klaus had already
been since Friday. We celebrated in rubber boots,
even though it was pouring cats and dogs.
Inge's evening at the club downtown we
and the day before yesterday we played board games.
Then Manfred suddenly played "Happy Birthday to
you." The next day, the group
presented me with breakfast
and we spent an hour doing sports
at the "Old Mill." We had
celebrated birthdays on April 28, 29, and 30.
How are things with Friedl again?
Have you been to see Grandma yet?
You don't tell me much, do you?
Have you already helped Juliane
out with the paint?
Does she have her spontaneity back?
getting used to being alone again?
and we weren't together much
in a family with lots of people.
One isn't always dependent on
that, you go to the movies
sometimes, or chat with
one person, or with several together, you also have more
space than we did in our room, it's
a shame that we didn't so often
walk the same paths.
Of course it was more noticeable, since
living together with the family was
what it was. I would be sorry if
you told me what, in your eyes,
I did to be friendly or cold.
I'm just wired differently than you.
I do like her, and it's nice,
Jerusalem up there in the row, because
I know it well, so one knows what
to write and talk about. And
to explain everything to everyone
if the end isn't imaginable.
How are the trees?
write that they are budding again.
You're probably happy about the rhubarb.
It's still like winter, but then comes
the first warm weather, and
in two weeks the blossoms will be out, and
in 4 weeks, summer. It's a shame one
can't get it here.
I thought I would have more time now, but
that's not the case since the time change.
A lot of work, there are always visitors
needed, you see I have a photo
of compositions, sort of in the direction of
preparations, made with
