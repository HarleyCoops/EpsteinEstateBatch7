  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reason": "The letter starts by mentioning postponing a wedding until January and discusses finding a room in Vancouver. The second page continues this topic, describing the room and giving impressions of Germany from the ship journey. The third page continues these impressions and mentions joining a choir. The flow is very coherent."
