Vancouver, Dec. 19/60

Dear Ursel!
I wish you a very
restful Christmas season
and a good new year.
Hopefully you received a greeting
and a little package from us?
And how are you?
Or the boy? Is your
sleeping going
badly or is Ovaltine
helping? I think about that and often
about your fate and it makes me very
sad.
I'm lazy too, which I can't afford at all.
I can't be lazy, because I don't have time for it,
and full, that is my laziness. I have
done my gymnastic exercises, I have
made alcohol once, I have
once done other exercises, the Brandenburg Gate
and a deep knee bend, and once I have for sleeping
now oil, so that I sleep well, and when
bending at the knees, and once
and I do the exercises so I'm
not so stiff, right? Yes,
situations were in all agree-
calculated, that we the
hours sleep, so
their whole life we
Saturday and Sunday,
3 weeks vacation, 21 days,
and sometimes 8-10 days, that
is, yes, rare, in the past one was
still, like us in Berlin
in a hut? I once
in one year wanted
more than a European in
9 months buys, I have
once 70 days, then
once in the remaining 5 months
106 days in the year.
