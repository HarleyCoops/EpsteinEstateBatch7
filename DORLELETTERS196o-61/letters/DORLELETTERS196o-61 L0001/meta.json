  "reason": "The letter starts with a date 'Vancouver, Aug. 20, 60' and a salutation to 'Liebe Mutter'. The pages follow a logical sequence, discussing a bear encounter, then transitioning to climbing (Klettern), and finally mentioning friends Wilma and Edna. The second page ends mid-sentence and the third page continues it perfectly."
