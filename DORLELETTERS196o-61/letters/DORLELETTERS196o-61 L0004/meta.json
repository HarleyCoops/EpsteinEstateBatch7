  "reason": "The letter begins with a date 'Nov. 3/61' and salutation 'Liebe Mutter'. It discusses returning to Vancouver, bank work, and ski patrol. The second page continues the ski patrol topic ('gebrochene Knochen'). The third page provides a fitting closing from 'Karl', who is also mentioned on the second page. The connection between the first and second pages is thematic but strong."
