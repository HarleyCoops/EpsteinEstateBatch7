  "reason": "The first page is dated 'Vancouver Jan 4/62', addressed to 'Ulla', and mentions wedding preparations. The second page seems to continue a discussion, mentioning 'Karl' and a trip to the Okanagan valley. The third page continues the description of a dry, snake-infested region, which fits the description of the Okanagan. The connection is thematic."
