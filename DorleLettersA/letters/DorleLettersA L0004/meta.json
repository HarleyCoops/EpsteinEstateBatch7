  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reason": "The first page starts with a birthday wish for 'Mutter' and describes a ski trip to Mt. Baker. The second page continues the description of the trip, mentioning the plan to start at 2 am, and then transitions to family concerns about 'Ursel'. The third page concludes the letter with a discussion of gifts (a record with Australian folk songs), mentions being in a 'Hütte' (hut), and signs off as 'Deinem Dolf', which fits the context."
