  "reason": "The first page is dated 'Vancouver, Dec. 14, 59' and begins with Christmas wishes. It mentions a recent trip and the 'Yellowstone Park'. The second page continues the description of Yellowstone Park in detail. The third page concludes the travelogue, mentioning Toronto, the baptism of 'Ursel Schnell', and then transitions to current ski activities at Mt. Baker, ending mid-sentence."
