Dear Mother,
For Christmas, I wish you all the best and a
very merry, peaceful Christmas. I hope
my letters still arrive in time.
I made so much myself this year, so I was
very busy. I hope the package has also
arrived. The cardigan is knitted from Indian
wool; many people here wear them,
and the Indians wear them as an outdoor jacket.
Unfortunately, I couldn't wash it anymore
but only steamed it. The slippers
are from Alaska, made by Indians. Unfortunately,
the whole report is still not finished.
I also baked this year.
Hilda cookies and Kuttlbadn.
What actually became of the Krumm
Cachkamm? Will it be
subdivided?

I wish you and yours
a very happy
New Year and less
and fewer worries.
Warm regards,
Your Joh.
