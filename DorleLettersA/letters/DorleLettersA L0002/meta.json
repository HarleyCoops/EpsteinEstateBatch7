  "reason": "The first page is dated 'Vancouver Mai d. 20, 59' and mentions being at Mt. Baker. The second page continues the topic of Australians and mentions plans to climb Mt. Baker. The third page describes the successful ascent of Mt. Baker ('letzten Sonntag den Mt. Baben endlich bestiegen'). The signature 'Doph' on the last page is a plausible nickname for the author. The content flows logically from planning to execution."
