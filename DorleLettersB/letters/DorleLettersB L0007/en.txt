are on their European tour. They are Helen Barnes, Annette Neumann, and Susan Frey. I went skiing with them every weekend for 8 months, and every Sunday evening we would meet at their apartment and have dinner and listen to beautiful music. Originally, they had planned to go to Norway and Sweden first, and only come to Germany next year. But now they have changed their plans and are going directly to Germany. I had, of course, given them your address, because it's always nice to have addresses in a country where you don't know anyone. So they have now written that they want to visit you in Stetten. I know how little time you have, and I hope you don't mind. But maybe they could also stay the night there, or take a trip from there to Marienau or Muersterung or somewhere else. These Australian people have never seen anything old, anything truly prehistoric. Perhaps you'll even have time to take a trip with them. I would gladly send you some money, but I actually know that it's more the time that you don't have. The package that I sent a while ago is meant to help you just a tiny bit with your work. Does the Nestee taste good, by the way? I'm drinking a lot of tea now too, more out of politeness among all the Australians and English, but I don't know what is good and what is bad tea; to me, it all tastes the same.

I also gave Helen, Annette, and Sue Uncle Hans's address and the one for the children's home. I want to send this letter off now, I'm writing at
