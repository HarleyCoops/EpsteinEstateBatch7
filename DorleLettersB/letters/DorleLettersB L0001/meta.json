  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reason": "This long letter from 'Karl' is dated Vancouver, Sept 22, 1958. The pages follow a logical sequence discussing his arrival in Vancouver, finding a job at a bank, social life, bank fraud incidents, and future plans. The content flows smoothly from one page to the next, and the letter concludes with a closing signature. The high page count is unusual, but the narrative is consistent."
