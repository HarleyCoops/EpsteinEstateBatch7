  "confidence": 0.7,
  "reason": "The first page is dated 'den 30. März, 51' and discusses Easter. The second and third pages discuss various topics like theater, bank robberies, and family news without clear transitions, but they share a similar fragmented and somewhat disjointed writing style, suggesting they might belong to the same letter from a single author."
