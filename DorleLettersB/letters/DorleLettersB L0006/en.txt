Dear Ursel!
For Christmas, I wish you all the best and a very nice holiday. The year went by so quickly; a year ago I was with you.
This year for Christmas, I will be going into the mountains to the youth hostel with the Canadian youth hostellers. That will certainly be very nice. Do you notice something about the drawing? The thick black star up there on the beam actually started out as a thick, ugly inkblot. Is it terrible that I'm sending it to you anyway? I'm just such a messy person. How is the weather over there with you?
Canada has a lot of snow this year; even we in Vancouver had snow once two weeks ago, which very much outraged the Vancouverites. They are not at all prepared for snow and cold. Often, roses are blooming in Vancouver at Christmas, and in February everything is in full bloom again. That would be the weather for you. But it also often has fog, and what fog it is! You can't see two steps ahead; drivers often have to get out and see where they are. On our street, a woman was recently sliding around for half an hour. In Alaska, there is lots and lots of snow now. I often get mail from the Bitners, they are my travel companions. It gets dark there at 2 o'clock now, and it's often 40 or 50 degrees below zero. That would probably be too cold for you. I would love to be there for a few years; the scenery is magnificent. In general, the entire landscape around the Alaska Highway is so beautiful that you really ought to take a picture at every step so that others can see it too.
On Friday evening, we're having a Christmas party at our bank director's house, which will certainly be nice. He is very young, not what you would otherwise imagine a director to be, only 39 years old and up for any nonsense. So we always have a lot of fun.

I'll write more after Christmas; I'm very busy right now.
Hopefully the blouse fits you; it is genuine handiwork.
Warm Christmas greetings,
your Jmh.
