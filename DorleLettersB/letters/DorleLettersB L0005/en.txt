Dear Mother,
How are you? Do you have help for
the summer? Is the helper still there?
How is the weather over there? I
heard that there's a big drought
in northern Germany.
The weather here has been very strange
this year. Summer is at least
a month late. The snow in the
mountains just would not melt.
Even now there is still a lot of snow above
2000 meters. We went skiing again
last weekend on Mt.
Baker. It was glorious. Up to 2000 meters
everything is green and in bloom, only the
glacier comes down between the flowers.
The glacier "speaks," as they
say here. It groans and rumbles and
thunders; it's moving. Huge crevasses
furrow through it. Above 2000 meters,
everything is white, except for the
protruding rocks. And out of those
grow the most beautiful mountain flowers. Not like in the Alps, more like
in rock gardens. One of us is taking
pictures with a telephoto lens
and a Leica. I lowered him down the rock face
on a rope, where the colors
were even more vibrant and the blossoms even
larger. It's funny, the higher you go,
the worse the living conditions,
the more beautiful the flowers become.
The most beautiful is the "Indian Paintbrush,"
a fire-red
blossom. We climbed up over the
glaciers, right up to deep glacial crevasses
whose depth you couldn't estimate.
We had ice axes and crampons
with us, which makes it easier and safer.
It was a glorious ski down.
You had to be very careful, though,
because you could only see the crevasses
when you were right in front of them. We
jumped over some of the smaller ones
on our skis as we went.
I received a letter today from my
Australian friends, who are now
