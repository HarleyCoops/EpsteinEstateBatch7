  "reason": "The letter starts with 'Banff, Nov. 14,64' and a salutation to 'Ursel'. It mentions the children Christopher and André, a Volkswagen, and a new station wagon. The second page continues the topic of the station wagon and describes the children's behavior, mentioning Banff, Eric, Christopher, and André, which directly links it to the first page."
