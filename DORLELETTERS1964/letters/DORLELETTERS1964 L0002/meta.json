  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reason": "This letter starts with 'Banff, Oct. 26, 64' and 'Liebe Mutti,'. The following pages discuss the children André and Christopher, their growth, and requests for items like a 'Trainingsanzug' and shoes. The content flows logically from general updates to specific requests and ends with a closing and postscripts. The text on some pages is fragmented, which slightly lowers the confidence, but the recurring names (André, Christopher, Eric, Hans) and topics create a coherent letter."
