      "reason": "The letter starts with 'Banff, Nov. 14,64' and a salutation to 'Ursel'. It mentions the children Christopher and André, a Volkswagen, and a new station wagon. The second page continues the topic of the station wagon and describes the children's behavior, mentioning Banff, Eric, Christopher, and André, which directly links it to the first page."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "This letter starts with 'Banff, Oct. 26, 64' and 'Liebe Mutti,'. The following pages discuss the children André and Christopher, their growth, and requests for items like a 'Trainingsanzug' and shoes. The content flows logically from general updates to specific requests and ends with a closing and postscripts. The text on some pages is fragmented, which slightly lowers the confidence, but the recurring names (André, Christopher, Eric, Hans) and topics create a coherent letter."
