Peter Bartl is there too, even though she doesn't speak English well. Shorthand isn't hard for me; it just moves much too slowly at school. On Monday we have another performance in the gym for "National Health Week." We've been practicing "New Life" again, which is a dance with jump ropes and hoops. It's really a lot of fun. I thought right from the start that gym class, I think, is the only thing I like here. It's the best thing about the whole school. Trampoline, jump rope, basketball, and floor exercises. We play almost every day. There's another ballgame tournament next week.

I'm not. I was just at Sigismund's and showed him the booklet. He had his doubts about our pronunciation, since everyone except Reinhold is actually German. But I think we should try it anyway. I'll see if we can fill a whole evening with the play, some choir pieces, and musical performances. It is a lot of work, having to take care of everything like this, especially since I'm overloaded with night school again. I have pottery again (where I'm now on the electric wheel), then gymnastics (mechi is also going once a week now), and then shorthand and typing. You always have to do homework in shorthand and typing, too. By the way, were you serious about the secretary position at Uncle Max's? That would really be something. I'd certainly be interested in that.

Yesterday, Sunday, we set off in three cars at 4 o'clock in the morning, because we wanted to go for a hike. We drove to Collingwood on Georgian Bay and climbed around in caves and rock crevices there, and took excursions through the forest. It was so beautifully sunny and

Vancouver, July 31, 1955

Dear Dorli and Mucki,

Lots of love and greetings! I’ve just started my journey home—westward. Despite the dreadful weather, not to say rotten, my time here after so many wonderful days felt all too short. After all, one needs time for everything, and the sun demanded its share of attention as well.

Warmest wishes and a kiss,
Your Grette

Toronto, January 3, 1956

Dear Uncle Max,

I know it’s been a long time since I last wrote to you. But I’m sure you’ve heard from Grandma what I’ve been up to and that I’m doing well. I’ll get right to the point without too much of a preamble. Mother wrote to me that you’re looking for someone to take on some of your work and lighten your load. I don’t know what your requirements are or if I would be up to them, but the work sounds very appealing—handling your correspondence and helping out wherever I could. I’ve taken a shorthand and typing course here, and I’ll be looking for an office position in the spring anyway. It’s true I had a lot of office work to do during my two years as a dietitian’s assistant, but I would much rather work my way up to being a secretary; I think that would be a profession that would satisfy and fulfill me. How about a trial period? That way, it would just be as if I had taken a vacation from Canada for a while, and I could always come back. Dear Uncle Max, please don’t think I’m building castles in the air and that I’ll be heartbroken if nothing comes of it. This was just an attempt, a job inquiry, and I’ve learned here that you don’t always have immediate success with those. You just keep looking. But I did want to tell you that I would have been happy to have the opportunity; it would be a real challenge.

With love,

Your Dorle

It's not easy, especially when you have to deal with the church sextons every Sunday—that's strenuous too. Being the only custodian, I have to carry a 40-pound sack every hour through the sand, without a fork. On top of that, we live on a mountain, and getting home is always a climbing expedition. People often turn green, and even skilled climbers can hardly see, so it's like being over 3000 meters up.

Working at the bank is a lot of fun, though it's also a lot of work at both locations here in Vancouver. The police are constantly in the bank, which is a nuisance. But you see a lot, of course, and you have to be on your toes. I've now developed a good nose for forged or uncovered checks, and there are a lot of forgeries. That's just how it is in Canada. The banks don't have enough staff, so many businesses can't make their payroll, the workers hardly get paid, and so it goes, around and around.

Well, now I have to get to work. I'm doing well and am on top of things, though I always feel that time is passing much too quickly now.

Warmest greetings to you all.

that they might have them here. But if you can't get a nice one for 50 DM, feel free to spend more—it can be an Easter present or a belated wedding anniversary gift as well!

The winter here is actually colder than in recent years, with quite a lot of snow and sunshine every day. We very, very rarely have grey winter days here; it's either snowing or the sun is shining. And even with the sun, it doesn't immediately start to melt; everything is still frozen solid. We only get fog here maybe three times a year. In Calgary, they have 2.70 meters of snow.

So I can be very glad next year that the skirt was too tight for Christel. I wouldn't have thought it—it was 5 sizes larger than mine. But it seems to be the different diet and the air here that makes you thinner; Mechi has lost weight too. You get bad teeth in return, though. The dentists here say that's the case for almost all new Canadians. Mechi's mouth is full of cavities too, but she's waiting for the German health insurance to deal with the fillings and toothaches. As you know, here you pay

and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the outing once again. In the evening, however, we had to be back by 8 o'clock for the club, where we heard a fascinating lecture on the influence of world history on the Church. A good speaker can make even the most boring topic interesting. Inge and Klaus are coming to the club more often again now; Klaus really likes it with us. I'm there even more often, though of course not as much as I used to be. Inge has started going to gymnastics again, but naturally she has more to do with the household now. Klaus is an electrical engineer and has a position as a technical draftsman. Imagine, just 8 days before the wedding, his sister and his cousin were killed in an accident in Germany. That's why we kept the wedding so small. The ceremony was at 10:30 in the morning and was truly lovely; Dr. Gögginger does such a nice job. Manfred and I were the witnesses. Otherwise, apart from the pastor's wife, no one else was in the church, since the youth group was away on a trip. Afterwards, we had the wedding meal: potato salad and schnitzel.

Monti, 17.12.55

Dear Aunt,

I wish you all the best for Christmas and a very merry and peaceful holiday. Do you have any snow? Here it snows a little almost every day, and it’s always cold, sometimes even down to -15° Celsius. Getting across the lake will be difficult now, too. A cold Advent.

Well, maybe it will work out for Christmas, but we’re already working in the evenings after church; one service is at 6 o’clock, and ours is at 10 or 12. The barbecues at Inge and Klaus’s are very good. Inge is baking and making potato salad with those poor boys. As a group, we aren’t doing anything other than our usual group night on Sunday evening.

As for the Christmas performance: Guess what they’re planning? A shadow play on Saturday evening. For everything else on Sunday, the hall might be too jam-packed, like last time when we had to set up chairs. The counts were sitting in the first row, with civilians right behind them. At least they couldn’t complain, because the costume wasn’t too difficult. I had on the dirndl I mentioned and a green one underneath—I know you can’t really picture it, but everyone who has a good one did.

---

Everyone had their own idea about how a role should be played. So at first, I just let them play their parts without saying anything, and if something was good, even if it was different from how I remembered it, I left it that way. I figured it’s better for them to act naturally than to have something else drilled into them. Herod’s scene, for example, is a bit different from how we used to play it. Herod doesn’t start out on the throne; instead, he has this very pronounced play of expressions, and you can see the rehearsal in his every step. It would be a shame to change anything about it; it’s meant to be that way. Heinz is also very good as Walther, and Gerhart as the Moor. Maria is doing very well, too, and Joseph is just delightful. He’s a very Berlin-style Joseph, but Joseph nonetheless. The actor playing Herod is also a soldier, so I’m sure it will work out fine. Even now, he has to try on his costume to perform in the afternoon. His wife is playing her part well, which is to say the part is almost unplayable—Stoffel is good. I’m quite confident. It’s on the evening of the third Sunday of Advent, and the invitations have already been sent out.

The Star Singers Urkant, Ellen, Dagr, and An put on white robes and carried a star for the one with the golden circlet in her hair, and one for the herald. Right after that, the garden was sent for, and as the curtain drew back, I followed with “Glory to God in the highest.” We had to watch every scene within eight minutes, so we had a bit of a dance each time. Then came the Annunciation with Mother and Sybille as Gabriel. I had made a foil for Mother, and she wore a little Christ-child gown and had a little star on the gown underneath. The inn scene: Joe as the innkeeper with an apple, potatoes, and my Vera as the mean innkeeper’s wife, and Sybille as Joseph climbed onto a green cloth on the floor, wrapped in a gray one, with a beard and a staff. We probably should have left out the manger scene, since it always went poorly in rehearsals. Then one was fed. For the shepherds, his pelt was on the stage, but otherwise with

Mont Laurier, July 12, '55

Dear Luti,

Well, half our vacation is already over. It’s been simply wonderful. Every day we've spent 2-3 hours in the water—on the air mattress, that is. We don't do any cooking; we eat cucumbers, canned peas with vinegar and oil, and bread, grapefruit and oranges, and dried apricots. Sleeping in the car is working out great. Here's how we do it: towards evening, we wash up and change at a lake, and when it gets dark, Inge gets into her sleeping bag in the back and we drive to the next town, where we then sleep either by the first houses or at a gas station. Early in the morning, around 5 o'clock, I crawl out of my sleeping bag and drive off before people show up; Inge is usually still asleep in the back. At the next lake we wash up and have breakfast, and then we drive on a ways until we feel like stopping for a swim at midday.

We haven't planned our route at all, and that's the best part. After we left Montreal, we followed the river to Quebec. Quebec is wonderful, an American city with city walls. From Quebec we headed north, still along the St. Lawrence River, though at times the road went into the mountains, which is to say, it is

Toronto, November 19, 1955

Dear Mutti and siblings,

How are you all? I hope to have more time in the evenings now, but it's always a challenge because of school. I'm in school every evening again this week: pottery, gymnastics, typing, and shorthand. Sunday is youth group night, so there's little time left over. Being the secretary is a lot of work, too.

But I felt guilty this summer when you wrote about all your work for Fiten, while I was going swimming at 3 o'clock after my own work.

Between my last letter and this one, I've started writing with a fountain pen again. I think it's one that dates back years, which I found in a box. It's the kind of pen Bartel got, you know, the one where you can change out the nibs in the front. And to think that for the same price as all that, you can get a ballpoint pen. Anyway, you're the only one who hasn't been given a pen like that.

Do you know what I made today in pottery? Cake pans.

...in Trenklamm, gets extra tutoring and tries to catch up. If that doesn't work, you can't take the Abitur exam in that subject, provided it's an elective. That's how you might end up in 7th grade for math but 11th for everything else.

We're already starting to make plans for our apartment. We're celebrating New Year's at our place, and we think we'll have a proper portion of Italian potato salad and sausages—since all the others make theirs with vinegar and onions. They won't be drinking any alcohol, so we'll make a hot punch and some baked goods. We'll have a roast, which we'll drive over and eat cold the next day. And good for 8 o'clock in the morning for skiing!? It's a shame we can't just send it to Uncle Max once. The best thing would be for me to send it back to Uncle Hans, don't you think? That's where it would get there fastest. You know, if only Uncle Max were just on a trial basis, apart from the travel, of course, if it's already nice for a while. Then we can... at our place... or something. But I'm quite sure, and I would like to... it is and...

Warmest regards and all the best,
Your B.C. (Name?) Uncle (?)

But until now there has been talk all over town about vitamins, and now it's really happening: all the flour and other foodstuffs are being enriched with them, so our bread is actually full of vitamins. With the best will in the world, though, we can't fool ourselves about sugar. We need it for Jochen, but saccharine (artificial sweetener) will have to do. Six letters for him have now arrived at the post office. He is also cheap, but Jochen costs nothing either, 10¢ a pound.

We have slaughtered a lot since I've been away, and we've planted 12 young seedlings on the rented land. Herr Getzel is getting 9 eggs a day now, so he's well-equipped. That's enough for a while, and then the soil will be used up and the plants will be on the decline. It’s almost a shame, but that’s just how it is. He’s having success with it, though.

Warmest regards,
Jrek

I used to think this whole vitamin craze was exaggerated, but it's really important here in the city. All the flours, milk, and other foodstuffs are artificially enriched with vitamins, so that the local cotton-wool white bread actually contains the same vitamins as whole-wheat bread. By the way, speaking of artificial things, they now have a saccharine (sweetener) here that you honestly can't tell apart from sugar. We use it in the hospital for our diabetics and for weight-loss regimens. It's also very cheap, but then again, sugar costs next to nothing here, 10¢ a pound.

The Betzels wrote to me again. Since I left, they have put in 812 morgen of new plantings, mostly on leased land. Mr. Betzel does everything on Type 9 or now Type 4 rootstock with iron pipe trellising. A 20-year lease is long enough for that, because by then the soil is depleted and the planting is past its prime. That's the modern way, almost like the farmers do it here. But he's having success with it.

Best regards,
Dorle

Toronto, November 24, 1957

Dear Mr. Rössler,

Please forgive me for only now getting around to answering your kind letter of September 28th. Thank you very much for the photos. I was very happy to receive them. I recognized almost everyone, though I must say that the young people have changed quite a bit.

Today I sent you a small package by sea mail. Since I don’t know if it will arrive before the holidays, I wanted to let you know it is on its way. I sent it as a “Gift Parcel” so that you will not have to pay any duty on it. I declared the value as $8.00. The contents are: 2 lbs of Stollen, 1 lb of Lebkuchen, some chocolate, and 1 lb of coffee. I hope it brings you a little joy.

As for me, things are going quite well. I have a steady job and am still living in the same room. I am paying $10.00 a week for it. That is the normal price here. I have made the acquaintance of a fellow countryman from the Sudetenland, and we often spend our Sundays together. Life is quite expensive here, so one cannot afford any grand luxuries. A movie, for instance, costs $1.00.

I also sent a small package to Reverend Kern. I would be very grateful if you could let me know if he receives it.

How are things in our dear homeland? I hope this letter finds you all in good health.

I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

With kindest regards,
Your
D. Hofmann

and then all sorts of little "appetizers." I had baked a lovely buttercream cake and piped roses and pansies on top. The youth group had given Inge a beautiful tea set, which we used right away. Then we set off for Woodview, where the two Bliebtreus got out, and Manfred and I drove on. It was quite a long drive, over 300 miles (480 km); we reached the others in Baysville at 11:30 at night. Inge’s sister Hilde is doing well in Germany. She isn’t working yet but will soon start at an American office in Wiesbaden. She spent the whole summer traveling with her father in Holland, Belgium, and Italy. Our new apartment is very nice; we have more space now, but we also have a corresponding number of visitors. Sometimes half the group is here. You ask about Christmas wishes. I would really like a ski anorak with a hood, preferably blue. Or else a good camping stove. For smaller things, I’d like a case for my filters and lens hood that attaches to the strap, or a wash bag.

Or a nice blanket for my room. I still want to send you a blanket, but I think it might be better if you buy one for yourself. Warmest greetings from all of us.

---

We also did some baking—butter cakes, cheese sandwiches, and Kuntzel bread. Our Christmas tree is much younger and fuller than last year's; it's a real beauty. Pictures were taken again yesterday. Yes, I want to send you pictures.

On Christmas Eve, after church, we all went over to Inge's—Manfred, Siegfried, Heinz, Joe, the Edland sisters, and me. Since we were all very hungry, the 16 of us ate potato salad and sausages, as much as everyone wanted. Joe, our premier sausage-wrangler, took care of them. Then we lit the Christmas tree—that is, we plugged it in—and sang Christmas carols. Afterwards we played party games, had drinks, listened to records, and laughed a lot. It was only the next morning that we ate again.

On New Year's Day we're going to cook for 16-18 people and look at pictures. Hilde will be allowed to cook. She wrote about how she got a job with the U.S. Air Force, where there is also a club on base. She was given a program for a project there for a few days, and now he wants to give her that for Christmas as well.

You register your time and date, and on the way out they check to see if you've been hunting. It was a magnificent tour. Afterwards, we went right across the Laurentians to Shawinigan Falls and St. Jerome. From there we drove up the highway into the High Laurentians, again over 1000 meters high, but not so wild—more like the Allgäu, with proper Allgäu-style houses. As it turns out, a lot of Germans and Swiss people live there. And that's where we happened to pass by the "Santa Claus Village." It's such a lovely and tasteful place. Four businessmen from Montreal built it. Of course, they make money from it, but the complex cost them 200,000 dollars. It’s a large hill with about 7-8 colorful gingerbread-style cottages, each with something different inside. In one they sell Native American handicrafts, another has postcards, and another has goods or souvenirs. In the little chapel, there's a nativity scene, and you can ring the bell and make a wish. And in one cottage is Santa Claus with his sleigh; he talks to the children and gives them little treats. He spoke German with us and told us all about the place. Goats and llamas and little bear cubs wander around the garden and in the houses, all of them completely tame.

Toronto, October 10, 1955

Dear Mother,

The "Gotteskind" script arrived the day before yesterday. Thank you so much for it. I'm sorry you had such a hassle with it. But we got right to work today copying out the parts; I got three boys to help me. For now, we've assigned the roles as follows: (God the Father: André); (Angel Gabriel: Erika); (Joseph: Sigismund); (Mary: Michi); (Guldinsach: Uli); (Innkeeper's Wife: Vera); (Herod: Manfred); (Death: Werner); (Devil: Wolf); (Rabant: Horst Wermescher); (Michel: Horst Mielde); (Stoffel: Siegfried); (Cyrich: Werner Kjar); (Melchior: Hans Dieter); (Balthasar: Heinz); (Caspar: Reinhold). We're not yet sure about the Star Singers. I'm not acting in it, since I have to direct and there are more girls than parts anyway—at most, I might play the first Star Singer. The first rehearsal is next Sunday. Inge is going to make the costumes. We do have some good musicians in the group, though. Manfred plays piano well, and so does Hans-Dieter. Klaus (Inge's husband) plays the violin very well, as does Ellen. Werner plays the mandolin, and Reinhold plays the recorder in addition to the accordion. André also plays the piano very well. Uli plays the flute, but she has

The years Aunt Jette had Joe thrashed in his factory anyway, the one that was twisted and had blood on it. That really made a racket when he threw the sword from Karolus’s feet, and it was so childish that Karolus wished for peace if he didn't want to live. The attendant was Eckhard von Schwern. The Jester was a gloomy one, his face powdered white with a dark border. That was Werner Schmedter. In private he looks a little bit like a jester and also has a very deep voice. The Devil was already wearing tight pants, black breeches, a tight red cape, and a black cap with little horns. His face was black. He had a pitchfork and jumped around. The felt—it was bright right after it happened.

The last scene was good too, after I had marked out on the stage with Werner where the Saints should stand, who had otherwise stood next to the others. Jochen did their part very well, and we all sang “Still, still!” together. (We didn’t know the other one; we didn’t have any more text to practice with.) Afterwards, the important people came and told us it was the greatest thing the community had achieved since its founding. That was a lot of fun, too.

Well, she can’t do enlargements after her night shift, and Inge wanted to give her father a calendar. So I took the enlarging kit over to Inge’s and helped her with three prints. They all turned out great, though they’re framed a little crooked, but of course that was the stupid frame’s fault! My negatives were good, so it was no big deal that not a single one got ruined, and I finished ahead of schedule. My job has always been—Inge has my tripod, and I’m having a lot of fun with my camera. I prefer to pull it out on everyone, early in the morning or thereabouts, that’s the best time to snap pictures, but you do burn through film. I want to buy myself a bigger camera, if I can manage it. I think her name is ‘Krauss,’ she’s back home again; she’s in pain at home and is often looking through lists. Maybe it’s for real, not the least bit dry, just so full, I don’t know for sure. We don’t really get together for enlarging, since she’s often out, or right now she’s working for a month.

around 1000 meters high and resembles the Black Forest, except that the only road going through it is just a track, perhaps like the old road to Meranburg. The road was constantly going up and down; it was so steep we had to use first gear for the climbs and second for the descents. And then, every 2 miles, a glorious lake.

We spent the night in St. Simeon, where it was icy cold. The river is already salty there. A funny thing happened to us there, too. We always locked the car at night. In the Volkswagen, you can open the doors from the inside, but not from the outside. In the morning, we had a wash and then shut the doors, with the keys still in the ignition on the dashboard. By chance, the front hood, where the tools are, was open. So I thought I could probably pull off what those photo thieves in Toronto did. I bent a screwdriver into a hook and had the window pried open in a quarter of a minute. That was a stroke of luck, because we were only in our swimsuits in the considerable cold at 5 o’clock in the morning, and of course there are no more auto repair shops up there. Then came a wonderful stretch of country—mountains and lakes, all at about 1000 meters, forest, and just a few scattered houses.

We will also be performing *Wohl Dich in Dich* in Kitchener, St. Catharines, or Hamilton, and we will give the proceeds to the Church Association's fund for the churches. I've already come up with a nice idea for an optional activity we can do as a group: I'm going to run a sort of Lotto Quiz with them, where I ask 10 questions that they answer on a slip of paper. For example, if the question is "Capital Cities," you get a point for every unanswered question, and the first person to reach 50 points gets a book. The person who has the most correct points on a given evening gets to choose the topic for the next evening—for example, Napoleon, Goethe, Schiller, geometry, physics, or Charlemagne, anything really, as long as it's something everyone can look up in their encyclopedia or read about somewhere. That way, people will ask the questions on the following evening, and maybe they'll look into an encyclopedia more often to prepare for the next round. The whole thing only takes 10 minutes.

This is why I'm a member of the German church community—we can get very good books and such for $1.85.

I'll stop for today.

Many warm regards,
Dork

Monto, Sept. 19, 55

Dear Mother,

Just a quick note today. Mecki is developing pictures right now—an order for 450 of them—so I have to help with the fixing. But to get to the reason I'm writing: mecki and I had an idea that we could put on *The Child of God* with the youth group. Would it be possible for you to send it to us by airmail? We'll cover the postage; we've ordered 5 albums from Photopost anyway, so it can all go on one bill. We've already thought about who could play which part, but we need to start rehearsals as soon as possible.

Our trip was wonderful, the wedding of... he and... I'm writing this while I work, so I'll write more in a few days.

With love,
Dork

P.S. If Bärbel sends it right away, I’ll send a reel for the View-Master by return mail.

health insurance plan, not even the most expensive private one, covers the dentist, presumably because they would go bankrupt otherwise. The same goes for medication, unless you’re in the hospital. Now that it’s Health Week, there’s a lot of focus again on making sure everyone knows about vitamins and calories. I must say, they pay much more attention to that sort of thing here. People eat a great many fresh apples and oranges, and also far more fresh vegetables than in Germany, which can be bought at low prices. Salads are eaten much more often, especially coleslaw and lettuce, as well as raw carrots (just whole like that), raw celery, raw spinach (very good), radishes, sliced cucumbers (plain), and bell peppers. In fact, salad here is mostly eaten by hand, and there’s something fresh with every meal. Consequently, relatively few bananas are bought, even though they are so cheap, but they don’t have many vitamins and are so fattening. That might seem

of a wife; The shepherds were portrayed as Wickel, old and grizzled, and as Stoffel, with a beard, hat, a cloak, and high boots. Another was medieval, with a cap, wrapped feet, a short cloak, and a shepherd’s jacket, or there was Gyniak, with a basket, no head covering, wrapped leggings, and a fur vest. The portrayals of Gyniak and Wickel were meant to do justice to Cäcilia. The stable room had a magnificent effect, stippled so that it was clearly defined. The angel was supposed to be dressed like Gabriel, which looked good, before we went on, and we hummed “From Heaven Above to Earth I Come” while the angel

It wasn’t colorful and high up like heaven and little sheep. Then came one of our best scenes: Herod. Or doesn’t come across very well. He was dressed like that, with a white wrapped robe and a sash or cloak over it, and golden armbands on his free arm. The palace was like a Roman one, with green weapons, a helmet, and wrapped legs.

Toronto, 26.12.55 Dec. 26 1955

Dear Mutti!

I'm working a split shift all week, which means I have the 1st through the 4th off. So it's a good time to get my letter-writing done. First of all, thank you very much for the package. The anorak fits perfectly (only the sleeves are a tiny bit too long), and I like it very much. Now I can go skiing; I got skis from Inge, so now all I'm missing are the poles, which Erich still had. I can really use everything so well.

Grandma sent a package over, a gift from a cousin. Aunt Elfi sent a book about the Alps with photos by Fredi. They are really great. And Klaus gave me a wristwatch, since mine has been broken for 5 years. It feels quite strange to be wearing a watch again.

Thanks also for the cookies; we ate them all.

Dondo, Lindi District, July 27, '66

Dear Mother,

Your letter arrived today with the one from Uncle Max—thank you so much for it, and for your other letter as well. No, I didn't mean to let four or five days go by. The cards were included too. Theklutd's secretaries very often get money or clothes. John has all of that to spare, and it still fits perfectly. Aside from his apprenticeship, he gets £45-50 per week, which is a good 800 DM a month.

You know, Angel, here it's rare that a girl is truly interested and takes on responsibility—I see it with myself at the hospital.
