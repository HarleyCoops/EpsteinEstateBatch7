But until now there has been talk all over town about vitamins, and now it's really happening: all the flour and other foodstuffs are being enriched with them, so our bread is actually full of vitamins. With the best will in the world, though, we can't fool ourselves about sugar. We need it for Jochen, but saccharine (artificial sweetener) will have to do. Six letters for him have now arrived at the post office. He is also cheap, but Jochen costs nothing either, 10¢ a pound.

We have slaughtered a lot since I've been away, and we've planted 12 young seedlings on the rented land. Herr Getzel is getting 9 eggs a day now, so he's well-equipped. That's enough for a while, and then the soil will be used up and the plants will be on the decline. It’s almost a shame, but that’s just how it is. He’s having success with it, though.

Warmest regards,
Jrek
