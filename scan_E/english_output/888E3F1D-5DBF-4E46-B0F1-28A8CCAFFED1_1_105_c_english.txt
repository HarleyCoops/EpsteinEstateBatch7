Vancouver, July 31, 1955

Dear Dorli and Mucki,

Lots of love and greetings! I’ve just started my journey home—westward. Despite the dreadful weather, not to say rotten, my time here after so many wonderful days felt all too short. After all, one needs time for everything, and the sun demanded its share of attention as well.

Warmest wishes and a kiss,
Your Grette
