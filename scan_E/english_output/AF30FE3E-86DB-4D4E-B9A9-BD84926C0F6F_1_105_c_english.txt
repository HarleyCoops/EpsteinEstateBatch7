Toronto, January 3, 1956

Dear Uncle Max,

I know it’s been a long time since I last wrote to you. But I’m sure you’ve heard from Grandma what I’ve been up to and that I’m doing well. I’ll get right to the point without too much of a preamble. Mother wrote to me that you’re looking for someone to take on some of your work and lighten your load. I don’t know what your requirements are or if I would be up to them, but the work sounds very appealing—handling your correspondence and helping out wherever I could. I’ve taken a shorthand and typing course here, and I’ll be looking for an office position in the spring anyway. It’s true I had a lot of office work to do during my two years as a dietitian’s assistant, but I would much rather work my way up to being a secretary; I think that would be a profession that would satisfy and fulfill me. How about a trial period? That way, it would just be as if I had taken a vacation from Canada for a while, and I could always come back. Dear Uncle Max, please don’t think I’m building castles in the air and that I’ll be heartbroken if nothing comes of it. This was just an attempt, a job inquiry, and I’ve learned here that you don’t always have immediate success with those. You just keep looking. But I did want to tell you that I would have been happy to have the opportunity; it would be a real challenge.

With love,

Your Dorle
