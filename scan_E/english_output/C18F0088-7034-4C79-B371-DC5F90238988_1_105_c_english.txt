Once, a large brown bear nearly ran across our path. He was sitting in the grass by the side of the road, and when we drove by, he immediately turned around and trotted off to the forest. It’s a shame we couldn’t get a picture of him. In Chicoutimi we even went to the movies; we saw the same film as on my birthday, “Cinderella.” There’s a huge lumber industry everywhere there—the rivers are completely full of logs, so many I’ve never seen anything like it. We took a lot of pictures, so I’ll send some of those.

The next day we drove through Laurentide Park, which is a provincial park of 4000 square miles with 1600 lakes. Hunting is forbidden, but people fish for salmon up to 2 meters long and a type of trout. It’s hard to stay there for long, though, because on both sides of the road the forest is so primeval you can’t go two meters into it. But we went swimming anyway. The road is simply carved right out of the forest, with the felled trees still lying on either side. We had to stop once for two female moose crossing the road. And another time we saw two little bear cubs playing. Before the park
