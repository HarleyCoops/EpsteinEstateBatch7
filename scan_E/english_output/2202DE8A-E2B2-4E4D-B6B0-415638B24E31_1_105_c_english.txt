The years Aunt Jette had Joe thrashed in his factory anyway, the one that was twisted and had blood on it. That really made a racket when he threw the sword from Karolus’s feet, and it was so childish that Karolus wished for peace if he didn't want to live. The attendant was Eckhard von Schwern. The Jester was a gloomy one, his face powdered white with a dark border. That was Werner Schmedter. In private he looks a little bit like a jester and also has a very deep voice. The Devil was already wearing tight pants, black breeches, a tight red cape, and a black cap with little horns. His face was black. He had a pitchfork and jumped around. The felt—it was bright right after it happened.

The last scene was good too, after I had marked out on the stage with Werner where the Saints should stand, who had otherwise stood next to the others. Jochen did their part very well, and we all sang “Still, still!” together. (We didn’t know the other one; we didn’t have any more text to practice with.) Afterwards, the important people came and told us it was the greatest thing the community had achieved since its founding. That was a lot of fun, too.
