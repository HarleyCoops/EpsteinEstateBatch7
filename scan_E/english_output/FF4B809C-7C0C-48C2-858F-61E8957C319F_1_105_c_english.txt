Well, she can’t do enlargements after her night shift, and Inge wanted to give her father a calendar. So I took the enlarging kit over to Inge’s and helped her with three prints. They all turned out great, though they’re framed a little crooked, but of course that was the stupid frame’s fault! My negatives were good, so it was no big deal that not a single one got ruined, and I finished ahead of schedule. My job has always been—Inge has my tripod, and I’m having a lot of fun with my camera. I prefer to pull it out on everyone, early in the morning or thereabouts, that’s the best time to snap pictures, but you do burn through film. I want to buy myself a bigger camera, if I can manage it. I think her name is ‘Krauss,’ she’s back home again; she’s in pain at home and is often looking through lists. Maybe it’s for real, not the least bit dry, just so full, I don’t know for sure. We don’t really get together for enlarging, since she’s often out, or right now she’s working for a month.
