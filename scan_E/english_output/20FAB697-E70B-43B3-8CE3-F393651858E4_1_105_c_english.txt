around 1000 meters high and resembles the Black Forest, except that the only road going through it is just a track, perhaps like the old road to Meranburg. The road was constantly going up and down; it was so steep we had to use first gear for the climbs and second for the descents. And then, every 2 miles, a glorious lake.

We spent the night in St. Simeon, where it was icy cold. The river is already salty there. A funny thing happened to us there, too. We always locked the car at night. In the Volkswagen, you can open the doors from the inside, but not from the outside. In the morning, we had a wash and then shut the doors, with the keys still in the ignition on the dashboard. By chance, the front hood, where the tools are, was open. So I thought I could probably pull off what those photo thieves in Toronto did. I bent a screwdriver into a hook and had the window pried open in a quarter of a minute. That was a stroke of luck, because we were only in our swimsuits in the considerable cold at 5 o’clock in the morning, and of course there are no more auto repair shops up there. Then came a wonderful stretch of country—mountains and lakes, all at about 1000 meters, forest, and just a few scattered houses.
