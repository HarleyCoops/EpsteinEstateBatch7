and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the outing once again. In the evening, however, we had to be back by 8 o'clock for the club, where we heard a fascinating lecture on the influence of world history on the Church. A good speaker can make even the most boring topic interesting. Inge and Klaus are coming to the club more often again now; Klaus really likes it with us. I'm there even more often, though of course not as much as I used to be. Inge has started going to gymnastics again, but naturally she has more to do with the household now. Klaus is an electrical engineer and has a position as a technical draftsman. Imagine, just 8 days before the wedding, his sister and his cousin were killed in an accident in Germany. That's why we kept the wedding so small. The ceremony was at 10:30 in the morning and was truly lovely; Dr. Gögginger does such a nice job. Manfred and I were the witnesses. Otherwise, apart from the pastor's wife, no one else was in the church, since the youth group was away on a trip. Afterwards, we had the wedding meal: potato salad and schnitzel.
