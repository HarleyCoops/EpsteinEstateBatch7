and then all sorts of little "appetizers." I had baked a lovely buttercream cake and piped roses and pansies on top. The youth group had given Inge a beautiful tea set, which we used right away. Then we set off for Woodview, where the two Bliebtreus got out, and Manfred and I drove on. It was quite a long drive, over 300 miles (480 km); we reached the others in Baysville at 11:30 at night. Inge’s sister Hilde is doing well in Germany. She isn’t working yet but will soon start at an American office in Wiesbaden. She spent the whole summer traveling with her father in Holland, Belgium, and Italy. Our new apartment is very nice; we have more space now, but we also have a corresponding number of visitors. Sometimes half the group is here. You ask about Christmas wishes. I would really like a ski anorak with a hood, preferably blue. Or else a good camping stove. For smaller things, I’d like a case for my filters and lens hood that attaches to the strap, or a wash bag.

Or a nice blanket for my room. I still want to send you a blanket, but I think it might be better if you buy one for yourself. Warmest greetings from all of us.
