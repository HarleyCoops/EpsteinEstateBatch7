We also did some baking—butter cakes, cheese sandwiches, and Kuntzel bread. Our Christmas tree is much younger and fuller than last year's; it's a real beauty. Pictures were taken again yesterday. Yes, I want to send you pictures.

On Christmas Eve, after church, we all went over to Inge's—Manfred, Siegfried, Heinz, Joe, the Edland sisters, and me. Since we were all very hungry, the 16 of us ate potato salad and sausages, as much as everyone wanted. Joe, our premier sausage-wrangler, took care of them. Then we lit the Christmas tree—that is, we plugged it in—and sang Christmas carols. Afterwards we played party games, had drinks, listened to records, and laughed a lot. It was only the next morning that we ate again.

On New Year's Day we're going to cook for 16-18 people and look at pictures. Hilde will be allowed to cook. She wrote about how she got a job with the U.S. Air Force, where there is also a club on base. She was given a program for a project there for a few days, and now he wants to give her that for Christmas as well.
