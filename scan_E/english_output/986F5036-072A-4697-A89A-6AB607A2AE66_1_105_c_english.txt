Dear Mutti!

I'm working a split shift all week, which means I have the 1st through the 4th off. So it's a good time to get my letter-writing done. First of all, thank you very much for the package. The anorak fits perfectly (only the sleeves are a tiny bit too long), and I like it very much. Now I can go skiing; I got skis from Inge, so now all I'm missing are the poles, which Erich still had. I can really use everything so well.

Grandma sent a package over, a gift from a cousin. Aunt Elfi sent a book about the Alps with photos by Fredi. They are really great. And Klaus gave me a wristwatch, since mine has been broken for 5 years. It feels quite strange to be wearing a watch again.

Thanks also for the cookies; we ate them all.
