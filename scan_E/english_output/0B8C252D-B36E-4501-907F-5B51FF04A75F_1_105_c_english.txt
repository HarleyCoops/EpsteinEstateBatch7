You register your time and date, and on the way out they check to see if you've been hunting. It was a magnificent tour. Afterwards, we went right across the Laurentians to Shawinigan Falls and St. Jerome. From there we drove up the highway into the High Laurentians, again over 1000 meters high, but not so wild—more like the Allgäu, with proper Allgäu-style houses. As it turns out, a lot of Germans and Swiss people live there. And that's where we happened to pass by the "Santa Claus Village." It's such a lovely and tasteful place. Four businessmen from Montreal built it. Of course, they make money from it, but the complex cost them 200,000 dollars. It’s a large hill with about 7-8 colorful gingerbread-style cottages, each with something different inside. In one they sell Native American handicrafts, another has postcards, and another has goods or souvenirs. In the little chapel, there's a nativity scene, and you can ring the bell and make a wish. And in one cottage is Santa Claus with his sleigh; he talks to the children and gives them little treats. He spoke German with us and told us all about the place. Goats and llamas and little bear cubs wander around the garden and in the houses, all of them completely tame.
