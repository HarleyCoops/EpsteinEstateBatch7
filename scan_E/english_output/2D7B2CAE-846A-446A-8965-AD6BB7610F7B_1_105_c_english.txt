Toronto, November 19, 1955

Dear Mutti and siblings,

How are you all? I hope to have more time in the evenings now, but it's always a challenge because of school. I'm in school every evening again this week: pottery, gymnastics, typing, and shorthand. Sunday is youth group night, so there's little time left over. Being the secretary is a lot of work, too.

But I felt guilty this summer when you wrote about all your work for Fiten, while I was going swimming at 3 o'clock after my own work.

Between my last letter and this one, I've started writing with a fountain pen again. I think it's one that dates back years, which I found in a box. It's the kind of pen Bartel got, you know, the one where you can change out the nibs in the front. And to think that for the same price as all that, you can get a ballpoint pen. Anyway, you're the only one who hasn't been given a pen like that.

Do you know what I made today in pottery? Cake pans.
