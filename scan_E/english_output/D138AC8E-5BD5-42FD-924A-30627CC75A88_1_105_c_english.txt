Dear Mr. Rössler,

Please forgive me for only now getting around to answering your kind letter of September 28th. Thank you very much for the photos. I was very happy to receive them. I recognized almost everyone, though I must say that the young people have changed quite a bit.

Today I sent you a small package by sea mail. Since I don’t know if it will arrive before the holidays, I wanted to let you know it is on its way. I sent it as a “Gift Parcel” so that you will not have to pay any duty on it. I declared the value as $8.00. The contents are: 2 lbs of Stollen, 1 lb of Lebkuchen, some chocolate, and 1 lb of coffee. I hope it brings you a little joy.

As for me, things are going quite well. I have a steady job and am still living in the same room. I am paying $10.00 a week for it. That is the normal price here. I have made the acquaintance of a fellow countryman from the Sudetenland, and we often spend our Sundays together. Life is quite expensive here, so one cannot afford any grand luxuries. A movie, for instance, costs $1.00.

I also sent a small package to Reverend Kern. I would be very grateful if you could let me know if he receives it.

How are things in our dear homeland? I hope this letter finds you all in good health.

I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

With kindest regards,
Your
D. Hofmann
