You know, last year they put on a nativity play and really pulled out all the stops. It was also good publicity for our group, and right after the play, three people came and asked if they could join. Tomorrow the Sunday school is also putting on a nativity play, so of course we have to go and watch it. Today is the last day to mail the cards and letters, including the ones for Toronto, and I still have to write 45 cards.

Dear Mutti, I hope you can use the coffee maker. I was thinking that when you go to the market in the morning, you can set everything up, and by the time you've washed up in bed, or gotten dressed, or had breakfast, the coffee will be ready, and it never boils over. Take the thing for the coffee out and fill it with cold water, depending on how much you want, 4, 6, or 8 cups, but not less than 4 cups. (There are markings.) Then you put the tube with the coffee basket back in, and fill the basket with coffee—you’ll have to experiment to see how strong you want it. Put one of the filter papers in the bottom if you want, but it’s not necessary, it will be a cooler cup, warmer, when you the coffee will, put the lid on and plug the cord in.
