Everyone had their own idea about how a role should be played. So at first, I just let them play their parts without saying anything, and if something was good, even if it was different from how I remembered it, I left it that way. I figured it’s better for them to act naturally than to have something else drilled into them. Herod’s scene, for example, is a bit different from how we used to play it. Herod doesn’t start out on the throne; instead, he has this very pronounced play of expressions, and you can see the rehearsal in his every step. It would be a shame to change anything about it; it’s meant to be that way. Heinz is also very good as Walther, and Gerhart as the Moor. Maria is doing very well, too, and Joseph is just delightful. He’s a very Berlin-style Joseph, but Joseph nonetheless. The actor playing Herod is also a soldier, so I’m sure it will work out fine. Even now, he has to try on his costume to perform in the afternoon. His wife is playing her part well, which is to say the part is almost unplayable—Stoffel is good. I’m quite confident. It’s on the evening of the third Sunday of Advent, and the invitations have already been sent out.
