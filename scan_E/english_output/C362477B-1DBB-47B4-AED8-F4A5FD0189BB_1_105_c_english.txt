Monti, 17.12.55

Dear Aunt,

I wish you all the best for Christmas and a very merry and peaceful holiday. Do you have any snow? Here it snows a little almost every day, and it’s always cold, sometimes even down to -15° Celsius. Getting across the lake will be difficult now, too. A cold Advent.

Well, maybe it will work out for Christmas, but we’re already working in the evenings after church; one service is at 6 o’clock, and ours is at 10 or 12. The barbecues at Inge and Klaus’s are very good. Inge is baking and making potato salad with those poor boys. As a group, we aren’t doing anything other than our usual group night on Sunday evening.

As for the Christmas performance: Guess what they’re planning? A shadow play on Saturday evening. For everything else on Sunday, the hall might be too jam-packed, like last time when we had to set up chairs. The counts were sitting in the first row, with civilians right behind them. At least they couldn’t complain, because the costume wasn’t too difficult. I had on the dirndl I mentioned and a green one underneath—I know you can’t really picture it, but everyone who has a good one did.
