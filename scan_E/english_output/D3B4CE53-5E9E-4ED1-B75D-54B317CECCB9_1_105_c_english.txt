It's not easy, especially when you have to deal with the church sextons every Sunday—that's strenuous too. Being the only custodian, I have to carry a 40-pound sack every hour through the sand, without a fork. On top of that, we live on a mountain, and getting home is always a climbing expedition. People often turn green, and even skilled climbers can hardly see, so it's like being over 3000 meters up.

Working at the bank is a lot of fun, though it's also a lot of work at both locations here in Vancouver. The police are constantly in the bank, which is a nuisance. But you see a lot, of course, and you have to be on your toes. I've now developed a good nose for forged or uncovered checks, and there are a lot of forgeries. That's just how it is in Canada. The banks don't have enough staff, so many businesses can't make their payroll, the workers hardly get paid, and so it goes, around and around.

Well, now I have to get to work. I'm doing well and am on top of things, though I always feel that time is passing much too quickly now.

Warmest greetings to you all.
