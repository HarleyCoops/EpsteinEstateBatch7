Dear Mother,

Just a quick note today. Mecki is developing pictures right now—an order for 450 of them—so I have to help with the fixing. But to get to the reason I'm writing: mecki and I had an idea that we could put on *The Child of God* with the youth group. Would it be possible for you to send it to us by airmail? We'll cover the postage; we've ordered 5 albums from Photopost anyway, so it can all go on one bill. We've already thought about who could play which part, but we need to start rehearsals as soon as possible.

Our trip was wonderful, the wedding of... he and... I'm writing this while I work, so I'll write more in a few days.

With love,
Dork

P.S. If Bärbel sends it right away, I’ll send a reel for the View-Master by return mail.
