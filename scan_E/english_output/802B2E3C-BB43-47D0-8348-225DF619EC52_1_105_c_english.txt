We will also be performing *Wohl Dich in Dich* in Kitchener, St. Catharines, or Hamilton, and we will give the proceeds to the Church Association's fund for the churches. I've already come up with a nice idea for an optional activity we can do as a group: I'm going to run a sort of Lotto Quiz with them, where I ask 10 questions that they answer on a slip of paper. For example, if the question is "Capital Cities," you get a point for every unanswered question, and the first person to reach 50 points gets a book. The person who has the most correct points on a given evening gets to choose the topic for the next evening—for example, Napoleon, Goethe, Schiller, geometry, physics, or Charlemagne, anything really, as long as it's something everyone can look up in their encyclopedia or read about somewhere. That way, people will ask the questions on the following evening, and maybe they'll look into an encyclopedia more often to prepare for the next round. The whole thing only takes 10 minutes.

This is why I'm a member of the German church community—we can get very good books and such for $1.85.

I'll stop for today.

Many warm regards,
Dork
