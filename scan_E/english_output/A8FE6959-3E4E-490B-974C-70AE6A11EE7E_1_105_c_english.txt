I used to think this whole vitamin craze was exaggerated, but it's really important here in the city. All the flours, milk, and other foodstuffs are artificially enriched with vitamins, so that the local cotton-wool white bread actually contains the same vitamins as whole-wheat bread. By the way, speaking of artificial things, they now have a saccharine (sweetener) here that you honestly can't tell apart from sugar. We use it in the hospital for our diabetics and for weight-loss regimens. It's also very cheap, but then again, sugar costs next to nothing here, 10¢ a pound.

The Betzels wrote to me again. Since I left, they have put in 812 morgen of new plantings, mostly on leased land. Mr. Betzel does everything on Type 9 or now Type 4 rootstock with iron pipe trellising. A 20-year lease is long enough for that, because by then the soil is depleted and the planting is past its prime. That's the modern way, almost like the farmers do it here. But he's having success with it.
