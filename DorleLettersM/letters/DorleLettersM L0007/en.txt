Dayton, Ohio, November 6, 1951

Dear Uncle,

I've been in the U.S.A. for about 14 days now and have settled in to some extent. In Washington, we first had introductory lectures, and now our travel program has begun. I'm mostly traveling with an Austrian woman, with whom I get along very well. From here, we're going to Chicago and then for a month to the state of Utah to visit the Mormons, which I'm particularly excited about.
Now I would very much like to know what news you have from Canada. It's not so easy, after all, to get used to a foreign language. I'm often surprised how much I still miss when people speak quickly, even though I had imagined I could speak English. I also wanted to write you the address of Elly Graeffe's aunt in Canada, which I have now found out. Elly is staying with her until the beginning of December because she has to recover from an illness. So if you, Uncle, would like to write to her, the address would be:
Mrs. Elly Graeffe
% Mr. Bob Ellis
305 Lee Ave
Toronto Ontario
Canada

My own address is:
Woman's Bureau 1338
Department of Labour
Washington
U.S.A.

Warmest greetings to you all and a Merry Christmas.
Your Erni.
