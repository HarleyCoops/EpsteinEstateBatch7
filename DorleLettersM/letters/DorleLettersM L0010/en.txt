Dear Mr. Bezel,

In response to your advertisement in the daily press of 10.2., I am applying for the position of gardener in a family-run business, where I have three years of certified experience. The business is 3 hectares in size, predominantly fruit cultivation, with cows and pigs as small livestock. I have now completed the horticultural professional examination with a grade of 3. I am in a secure position, but would like to expand my knowledge in another business.

Respectfully,
Dora Hofmann
