  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reason": "This is a multi-page letter from Chile dated 20. Juli 1950, addressed to 'Fraeulein Hofmann'. The pages are linked by consistent letterhead ('Chacra San José de la Florida...'), date, and a continuous, formal discussion advising against immigrating to South America for work in agriculture. The content flows logically across the pages."
