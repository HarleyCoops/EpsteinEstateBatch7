  "reason": "The first page is a letter to 'Liebe Mutter!' from Hofheim, dated 19. Juli 51, discussing plans to go to Canada. The second page, signed by 'Dorle', discusses farm helpers and mentions names (Ursel, Erdmuthe) that fit the family context. The tone and likely sender connect these pages, although the content transition isn't seamless."
