  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reason": "These two pages form a cohesive autobiographical report about immigrating to Canada. Page one is explicitly marked 'Page 1' and describes the journey in 1951. Page two is marked 'Page 2' and continues the narrative from 1952 onwards. The content, style, and explicit page numbering confirm they belong together in this order."
