Dear Christel,
How are you? Have you grown any taller and filled out a bit? When I come back, you'll probably be able to carry me in your arms. You see, I'm not getting any bigger or heavier, because it seems you get thinner in this climate. The women here are all as slim as pine trees. Though if they all eat as much as we do here, I'm not surprised. Mrs. Duggan eats nothing at all in the morning, for lunch we have soup and toast, or eggs with ham, and always dessert. For dinner, so far we've always had mashed potatoes, and everyone has a tablespoonful at most. Then some can of vegetables or frozen vegetables is opened and seasoned, and then there's meat in huge quantities. A giant lump of butter goes into everything. For dessert, there's very often ice cream. You can buy most things here in cans, but they don't all taste of just one spice. You couldn't cook any better this way either. The fine vegetable soups, chicken with rice, green peas, canned fruit, spaghetti with tomatoes, etc.. The amount of food, leftovers, and buttered bread that gets thrown away here could feed a family of four and 2 fat pigs. The only thing that's carefully saved is the mashed potatoes, because you have to peel potatoes.
Warm greetings and a happy new
year! Dorle.
