The pages are linked by consistent letterhead ('Chacra San José de la Florida...'), date, and a continuous, formal discussion advising against immigrating to South America for work in agriculture.

Page two is marked 'Page 2' and continues the narrative from 1952 onwards. The content, style, and explicit page numbering confirm they belong together in this order."
