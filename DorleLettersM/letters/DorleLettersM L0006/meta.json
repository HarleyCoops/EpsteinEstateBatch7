  "reason": "This appears to be a multi-page letter to 'Liebe Mutter!' from 'Dorli'. The first page discusses apple prices in Frankfurt. The second page continues this topic and then mentions looking for work in Frankfurt. The third page, signed by 'Dorli', mentions a 'Fortsetzung nächstes Blatt!', indicating it's part of a longer letter. The common themes of apples, Frankfurt, and the signature link these pages, though the exact order is inferred."
