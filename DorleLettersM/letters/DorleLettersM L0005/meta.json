  "reason": "A multi-page letter likely from 'Dorli'. The first page starts 'Hofheim, den 22.11. Liebes Ulechi!'. The second page is a fragment asking questions that fit the context of a personal letter. The third page ends with the signature 'Dorli' and discusses gifts, which connects to the first page's mention of the Christmas market."
