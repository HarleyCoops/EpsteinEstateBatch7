Hofheim, November 22
Dear Ulechi!
Thank you so much for your
letter. When are you finally
going to send us your pictures from
Säntis? I've been waiting for them for
half a year. Are you coming
to visit us and Ewert?
On the first Sunday of Advent, there's a Christmas
market in Frankfurt. I'm going there to do some
shopping. What are you getting
your various relatives?
Are Friedl, Giesl and Mr.
Jeser gone already? Where are they ??? going, anyway? Is my
plant manager Mr. Auer already?
What's Ulla up to? Are you
is she staying longer? Does she have
a job yet?
Was it M. M. at Penn?
was it nice? Do you have
an address from England yet?
Today with Geyer that
or should I still played records.
That would be something
for you. I'm knitting
a sweater for myself,
white. With a wide fold-over collar.
I'm very pleased with it. Yesterday
Family ? was here. Wanted
to know something, actually. D'knitting. I get the things
in a trade, all cheaper than over there where you are.
You know that I'm always
on the hunt for books. The
Berge wool shirt is being traded
by Rudi Joos for the belt with
me. Just please, also find a
once you've tracked it down.
Whether it or Charis's
photo is better, almost without Muck
it is.

What should I get
Grandma?

Warm regards,
Dorli
