For exchange. Us for 100 RM (not 500, as was said before, the greedy Weisse doesn't know that either).
For now, we are settled again.
The Bratkeller is now coming over with the blossoming of the trees, it's going very slowly, as the wind is only just turning fair.
They will not be pruned. Beans and peas are already sown. Tomorrow we want to plant potatoes. We did end up doing the pre-blossom spray on the apples, just with copper. Mr. Wetzel has only just now learned that the cabbages and the beets are also dependent on the beans, peas, etc. I also once knew that bees die when they have stung. I also once knew what the characteristics of the goose breeds are, which I had inquired about. I haven't touched the cabbage patch yet, because for that I need a full day. Usually, that is not enough. I have written to the Müllers in Chile. Hopefully, they will like it very much.
Did the blossoms actually freeze? It came on the radio that the stolen cherry blossoms were only destroyed in certain areas. 4° C and sun on the trees. Hopefully, it is not so bad.
Warm regards,
Dora.
