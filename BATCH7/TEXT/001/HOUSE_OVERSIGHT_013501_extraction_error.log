Time and the reading by others will tell whether this idea was realized. The Fetzer\nFoundation and Dr. Gailey have facilitated exploration into blends of science and\nspirituality, particularly in the context of personal meaning. They also have a history of\nsupporting serious work in this era’s most powerful and rigorous exercise in holism as\nrepresented by the mathematical and applied mathematical fields of modern dynamical\nsystems theory. Fetzer’s very special environment and years of dedication have\nencouraged the variety of personal meanings within science to emerge and be recognized\nas legitimate and important parts of the research enterprise. It would be difficult to imagine\na more propitious context for this effort.\nThe book is dedicated to my daughter Buna, and to my intellectual and creative\ncompanion, Dr. Kare
