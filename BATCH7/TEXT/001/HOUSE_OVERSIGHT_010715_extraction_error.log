This made directors Steve McQueen,\nAlfonso Cuaron and David O. Russell very crazy. After\nmonths of screenings, press conferences, lunches, and\nparties, publicists and bloggers had to look these three wise\nmen in the eye and say, “We don’t have a clue.”\nThen came the slogan, “It’s time.” That was\nFox Searchlight’s last suggestion on 12 Years\na Slave advertisements that subliminally\nregistered in the hearts and minds of voters\nin the closing days of the studio’s low-key\ncampaign.\n“It’s time.” So simple.
