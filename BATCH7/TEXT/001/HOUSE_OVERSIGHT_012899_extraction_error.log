As a careful experimentalist, Leo would\nhave been properly skeptical of the big hypotheses made\nhere – but he would have been eager to see them put to the\ntest!\n\nPreface\nThis is a large, two-part book with an even larger goal: To outline a practical approach to\nengineering software systems with general intelligence at the human level and ultimately beyond.\nMachines with flexible problem-solving ability, open-ended learning capability, creativity and\neventually, their own kind of genius.\nPart 1, this volume, reviews various critical conceptual issues related to the nature of intelligence\nand mind. It then sketches the broad outlines of a novel, integrative architecture for\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) called CogPrime ... and describes an approach for giving a\nyoung AGI system (CogPrime or otherwise) appropriate experience, so that it can develop its\nown smarts, creativity and wisdom through its own experience. Along the way a formal theory\nof general intelligence is sketched, and a broad roadmap leading from here to human-level artificial\nintelligence. Hints are also given regarding how to eventually, potentially create machines\nadvancing beyond human level – including some frankly futuristic speculations about strongly\nself-modifying AGI architectures with flexibility far exceeding that of the human brain.\nPart 2 then digs far deeper into the details of CogPrime’s multiple structures, processes and\nfunctio
