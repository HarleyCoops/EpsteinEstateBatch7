The top photo shows a black private jet on an airstrip. The middle-left photo is a close-up of the jet's cockpit. The middle-right photo shows two men, identified as Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein, walking together. The bottom photo shows several people, including Stephen Hawking, inside a submarine. A small, framed, autographed photo is visible on the top right. The page has a footer with a document number.",
    "layout": "The page is laid out with multiple images and corresponding text blocks. A large photo of a jet is at the top. Below it are two smaller photos side-by-side: a cockpit close-up on the left and two men walking on the right. A larger photo of the interior of a submarine is at the bottom. Captions are placed next to or below their respective images. A document identifier is present at the bottom center of the page.",
