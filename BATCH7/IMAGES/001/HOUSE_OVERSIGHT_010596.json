Mr. Mattola's deposition was set by the law firm of Searcy Denny Scarola Barnhart and Shipley. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at ¶16.\n\n74. Edwards gave notice that he intended to take David Copperfield's deposition. Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so. Epstein's housekeeper and one of the only witnesses who did not appear for deposition with an Epstein bought attorney, Alfredo Rodriguez, testified that David Copperfield was a guest at Epstein's house on several occasions. His name also appears frequently in the message pads confiscated from Epstein's house. It has been publicly reported that Copperfield himself has had allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by women claiming he sexually abused them, and one of Epstein's sexual assault victims also alleged that Copperfield had touched her in an improper sexual way while she was at Epstein's house. Mr. Copperfield likely has relevant information and deposition was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at ¶17.\n\n75. Epstein also takes issue with Edwards identifying Bill Richardson as a possible witness. Richardson was properly identified as a possible witness because Epstein's personal pilot testified to Richardson joining Epstein at Epstein's New Mexico Ranch. There was information indicating that Epstein had young girls at his ranch which, given the circumstances of the case, raised the reasonable inference he was sexually abusing these girls as he had abused girls in West Palm Beach and elsewhere. Richardson had also returned campaign donations that were given to him by Epstein, indicating that he believed that there was something about Epstein\n\n31\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010596",
