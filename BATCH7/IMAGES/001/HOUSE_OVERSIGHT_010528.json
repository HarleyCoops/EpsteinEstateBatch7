The text is partially cut off on the left margin. The right page is from a book, Chapter 49, which also discusses Jeffrey Epstein and contrasts his case with that of Scott Blake. The document identifier 'HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010528' applies to the entire image scan. The full name of the police department is inferred from context and the website in the footer. The date '4, 2006' is interpreted as July 4, 2006, a common format, but could be another month. The date '23, 2006' is interpreted as June 23, 2006, based on the context of 'last week'.",
