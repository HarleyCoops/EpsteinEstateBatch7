The images depict Jeffrey Epstein in various contexts: with associates, at a courthouse, his mugshot, his jail cell, the jail facility, his private island, and his sex offender registry entry. The overall theme relates to Epstein's legal issues and properties.",
    "layout": "The page is arranged in a multi-panel layout, similar to a magazine or photo essay. Images and text captions are placed in a grid-like structure. A document identifier is located at the bottom right corner.",
