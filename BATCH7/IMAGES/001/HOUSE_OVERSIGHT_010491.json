The photographs depict: a black private jet on an airstrip, a close-up of a jet's cockpit, two men walking together (identified as Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein), a group of people inside a submarine (including Stephen Hawking), and a partial framed photo with a handwritten inscription. The page is slightly curved, suggesting it is from a bound volume.",
