For example, Jane Doe had a trial\nset for her civil case against him on July 19, 2010. As that trial date approached, defendant\nEpstein intimidated her in violation of the judicial no-contact orders. On July 1, 2010, he had a\n“private investigator” tail Jane Doe – following her every move, stopping when she stopped,\ndriving when she drove, refusing to pass when she pulled over. When Jane Doe ultimately drove\nto her home, the “private investigator” then parked in his car approximately 25 feet from Jane\nDoe house and flashed his high beam lights intermittently into the home. Even more\nthreateningly, at about 10:30 p.m., when Jane Doe fled her home in the company of a retired\npolice officer employed by Jane Doe’s counsel, the “private investigator” attempted to follow\nJane Doe despite a request not to do so. The retired officer successfully took evasive action and\nplaced Jane Doe in a secure, undisclosed location that night. Other harassing actions against\nJane Doe also followed.
