Toronto, January 3, 1956

Dear Uncle Max,

I know it’s been a long time since I last wrote to you. But I’m sure you’ve heard from Grandma what I’ve been up to here, and that I’m doing well. I’ll get right to the point without a long introduction. Mother wrote to me that you’re looking for someone to take on some of your work and lighten your load. I don’t know what your requirements are or whether I would be up to the task, but the work of handling your correspondence and helping out wherever possible would greatly appeal to me. I’ve taken a shorthand and typing course here, and I’ll be looking for an office job in the spring anyway. Although I did have a lot of office work to do during my two years as a dietetic assistant, I would much rather work my way up to being a secretary; I believe that would be a profession that would satisfy and fulfill me. How about a trial period? That way, it would just be like I’d taken a vacation from Canada for a while, and I could always come back. Dear Uncle Max, please don’t think that I’m building castles in the air and that I’ll be devastated if nothing comes of this. This was just an attempt, an application, and I’ve learned here that you don’t always have immediate success with those things. You just keep looking. But I did want to tell you that I would have been delighted; it would be a real purpose.

With love,

Your Dorle
