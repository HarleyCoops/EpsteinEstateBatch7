Banti is there upstairs at home, although she doesn't speak English well. Shorthand is not difficult for me, and so much is too slow in school. On Monday, we have another performance at school for sound on the occasion of "National Health Week"; we have again introduced new life, that is, silk blossoms and hoops. That's really fun. You ask about pictures, so yes, some Indian flowers are meant, mainly the small bells. Everything is a very good situation. Nevertheless, the best relationships are. Yesterday two of us played so that Mr. and Mrs. Contarte could listen to Beethoven there. The coffee was already ready; unfortunately, they couldn't join us for a meal. We have seven children there and could exclude. Send me the note that she has. It cost 13 $, which is 52 DM. Can you please take some money from me for that, however, not excessively large amounts. What does it really cost to do it like that? The money from me could me

not along. I was just at Sigismund's and showed him the booklet. He had concerns if we would manage the pronunciation, since, apart from Reinbold, everything is truly non-German. But I think we should definitely try it. I want to see if we can fill a whole evening with the play and with listening and musical presentations. It really is a lot of work when you have to take care of everything like that, especially since I'm overbooked again with evening school. I have pottery again (where I'm now on the electric wheel), then gymnastics (which I now do once a week as well), and then shorthand and typing. In shorthand and typing, you always have to do homework. By the way, what was the deal with Ernst and the secretary at Uncle Max's? That would be a position, though. I'd really be interested in that.
Yesterday, on Sunday, we set off in three cars at 4 AM, because we wanted to go on a hike to Collingwood on Georgian Bay, where we drove to and then climbed around in caves and rock crevices, and made excursions through the forest. It was so nice and sunny and

Vancouver, July 31, 1955
Dear Dorli and Meddi!
Many thanks for your beautiful and heartfelt greeting!
Homeward journey – the weather, despite a short, light rain, can now be described as mild – I received my mail after the third day, now all the ship business is done and I am going tomorrow morning with a friend to Toronto, where I will stay until Tuesday. Incoming mail and the letters remained with G. Bell.

Doesn't one just, when one has a lot of velvet, when the climber now starts and for gardeners that is strenuous and also. On the icy coasts are, one often has to for hours carry a 40-pound climbing bike through sand, not smoothly. Also on the egg mirror, that is always also a racing phenomenon, in order to, one feels a lot and experiences a lot. The climber can people and experienced climbers can already step over over 3000 [meters].
It's a lot of fun in the stomach. But much at both of places. At Vancouver, the police apparently had a lot of struggle in the school against one man with another, naturally known and when Vancouver went, an A. A. and there is now much there and also a hare for tortured. Just there one and Canada. The banks do not have enough money for large banks, so many businesses provide much and the bank not full, the workers cannot bring so much into the bank, so it is now at work. A. A. is often out and about, actually like one in order to always do a lot of money on it, that it now circulates too quickly.
Warm regards from Doll.

It's a pity what she gets here, but if you can't get a nice one for 50 DM, just take more, then it's still an Easter gift or a belated wedding anniversary gift!
In winter, it's actually colder here than in recent years, with quite a lot of snow and sun every day. Gray winter days are very, very rare here; either it snows or the sun shines. Even without the water immediately melting, everything is still rock-hard frozen.
Fog occurs here perhaps 3 times a year. In Calgary, there's 2.70 meters of snow.
Next year I can very nicely... that Christel's skirt was too tight, I didn't laugh, it was 5 sizes bigger than mine.

Mechi also has a mouth full of fever, but she patiently waits with toothache for the health insurance in Germany. Here, as is well known, one pays...

were, and everyone had truly enjoyed this outing again. In the evening, however, we had to be back by 8 PM for the club, where we listened to a very interesting lecture about the influence of world history on the church. A good speaker can make even the most boring topic interesting.

Inge and Klaus are now more often at the club again; Klaus really likes it with us. I am still there more often, of course not as much as before. Inge is going to gymnastics again, but she naturally has more to do with the household now. Klaus is an electrical engineer and has a job as a technical draftsman. Imagine, just 8 days before the wedding, his sister and his cousin died in a fatal accident in Germany. That's why we kept the wedding so small. The wedding ceremony was at 10:30 AM, which was really nice, as it was conducted very well. Manfred and I were witnesses. Otherwise, apart from Mrs. Pastor, no one else was in the church, as the youth group was away on a trip. Then we had the wedding meal, potato salad and schnitz-

Monte, December 17, 1955

Dear Aunt!
For Christmas, I wish you all the best and very happy, cozy holidays. Is it snowing at your place? With us, it snows a little almost every day, and it's always cold, usually around -15° Celsius. On Christmas Eve, we came home at 6 o'clock after the Christmas Mass, but we immediately went out again at 10 o'clock after the children's gift-giving. At 12 o'clock, we came home again and made potato salad. On the 1st Christmas Day, we came home from the group, as we had already been at your place on Sunday evening. On the 2nd Christmas Day, we had a group evening, and it was very cozy. Imagine how full the hall was, absolutely crammed, with people even sitting on the benches at the end. The children sat in the first row. Here at the final service, it's a bit different, because the costume wasn't quite right. I was wearing a golden-brown jacket, and with a green blanket wrapped around me, and I was wearing a golden-brown jacket that I can't really picture. Klaus plays very well and has a potato-

Everyone has a different opinion on how they should play their roles this time. So I have to say, it was good, even though it was different from what I remembered. I admit it, because it is then more believable. I find it better if we play it naturally than (how it is in) the Herodes scene. For example, it's somewhat different from when we played it; Herodes does not point to the throne, he is not so prominent at the beginning, and the Herodes scene is also constantly being revised. Of course, I want to try (to understand) what has been changed, it's a shame. It has been changed. Heinz is also very good as Wallmann and Gerhart too, and Josef is always there, and also such a little Josef, but Herrina can (handle) Josef. The hall is also quite something. Joe has already learned a lot, especially regarding how he handles his initial routines in each scene; after playing it well a couple of times, he almost doesn't need to play it anymore. Friedel Stoffel is also good. I really believe it will work out. It's on the 3rd Advent evening, and we have already sent out invitations.

Asked, it looked very good; said, it looked very good. Josef welcomed the Christmas carols that had been selected. She was not incapable. Ellen, Dagmar and Angelika vowed that evening to make a beautiful [setting for] the hearth, with one [of them] decorating the hearth. Immediately afterwards, Frede and I [performed] "Glory to God in every soul"; we had to sing and look, so that we stepped onto our mark every time. Then came the head teacher Mother and Sybille as Gabriel united, and every poem to a star and a new ne. The innkeepers: Joe as innkeeper. Apple with potatoes and my Gretel. Josef had a green robe reaching to the floor, and he was quite proud, and he is indeed very proud. Chair, where the crib scene was seen. We'd rather forget. Rehearsals were always practiced by ourselves. A filled one. At the shepherds, [something] stands on the stage, on the...

Mont Laurier, July 12, 55

Dear folks!
Now half of our vacation is already over. It was simply great. Every day we lay in the water for 2-3 hours, that is, on an air mattress. We don't cook, we eat cucumbers, canned peas with vinegar + oil, and bread, grapefruit and oranges and dried apricots. Sleeping in the car works great. We do it so that towards evening we wash and change at a lake, and when it gets dark, Inge already slips into her sleeping bag in the back and we drive to the next village, where we then sleep either by the first houses or at a gas station. Early in the morning at 5 o'clock I then crawl out of my sleeping bag and drive away before people arrive. Inge, of course, is still sleeping in the back. At the next lake, we then wash and have breakfast and then we drive a bit further until we are ready to swim at noon. We haven't planned our trip at all, that's precisely the best part. After we left Montreal, we went along the river to Quebec. Quebec is wonderful, an American city with city walls. From Quebec, we went north, still along the St. Lawrence River, but sometimes the road went into the mountains, i.e. it is

Toronto, November 19, 1953

Dear Mother and Siblings!
How are you all doing? Hopefully you are now again devoting more time to yourselves; hopefully there is still opportunity because of school. I am again in school every evening this week. Previously [I was] in typing and shorthand. And Sunday is youth evening and then I am writing work. In the summer I sometimes had a bad conscience when I wrote about your workers and I went swimming at 3 o'clock after work. I will not that to myself anymore, but I will not keep the plans. Everyone writes, which I believe I still found from 5 school cards. The pen I don't hold when listing with x against an advantage. And all this here, where one can write a bullet so easily. And all that gets one through the week; then the week starts with such a small Bin given as a gift, and Topfloppen, form cakes from do you know what I did today?

Vitamins, but in the city, that really becomes widespread, and all nice and many and other foodstuffs are artificially enriched with vitamins, so that water and bread actually have the same vitamins as whole-grain bread. By the way, since I'm on the subject of Saccharin (sweetener), it's now only available from sugar, but by no means is it sugar, and Type 9 or now Type 10€. That is much cheaper, but sugar costs much more. 10€ a pound of sugar costs much more. A vaccination plan for young people is made, if Mr. Schlegel does it all, and Type 9 or now Type 10€. That's enough, then it's up to the cooks and they utilize the plants. He has, but it is, and they utilize the plants. He has, but it is a very small effort, and they utilize the soils and do. He has, but it is a very small effort.

conjure up vitamins, but in the city that is really important, so all flours and milk and other foodstuffs are artificially enriched with vitamins, so that in the local cotton white bread there are actually the same vitamins as in wholemeal bread. By the way, now that I'm talking about artificial things, here there is now a Saccharine (sweetener), which cannot by any stretch of the imagination be distinguished from sugar. We use it in the hospital for our diabetic patients and the gentlemen on a diet. It is also very cheap, but sugar costs nothing here anyway, $10 a pound. We have also written to the Betzels again; since I left, they have made 8 1/2 Morgen of young plantings, mostly on leased land. Mr. Betzel does everything on Type 9 or now Type 4 with an iron pipe framework. A 20-year lease is sufficient, because then the soil is exhausted and the plants would fail. That is modern. It would almost ruin the farmers. But he has success with it. Best regards. Törle.

and then small gatherings, like 'appetizers'.
I had baked a beautiful buttercream cake, piped with roses and pansies on it. The youth group had given Inge a beautiful tea set, which was immediately inaugurated. Then we set off for Woodview, where the two stayed, and Manfred and I drove on. That was quite a nice stretch to drive, over 300 miles (480 km); at midnight we arrived at the others' place in Baysville.

Inge's sister Hilde is doing well in Germany; she is not working yet but will soon start at an American office in Wiesbaden. She spent the entire summer traveling with her father, in Holland and Belgium and in Italy.
Our new apartment is very nice; we now have more space, but we also have proportionally more visitors. Sometimes half the group is here. You ask about Christmas wishes. I would really like an anorak for skiing with a hood, preferably blue. Or accessories, a camping stove. For small items, I would like a case for filters and a sun visor, to attach to the strap, or a wash bag.

or I would like a nice thick blanket.
I would like to wish you and your parents a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Yours, Inge

also baked, made butter, small bread and kneaded bread. Our Christmas tree was much bigger and more fully decorated than last year; he took seven pictures, and many pictures were desired/taken. On Christmas Eve, after mass, we went to Inge's: Manfred, Inge, Heinz, Joe, Edmund, sisters, nieces. Since we were all very hungry, we ate potato salad, sausages, and cake. 16-18 men always slept. City dwellers cannot do that, those who write about Christmas and so on, like we do in our forests. With us, everyone has seen a lot of the place and the landscape.

where one registers, time and date, and at the exit, one is checked to ensure one hasn't hunted. That was a great tour. Then we went across the Laurentians to Shawinigan Falls and St. Jerome. From there we drove up the highway into the High Laurentians, again over 1000 meters high, but not as wild, more like Allgäu, with proper Allgäu-style houses. Many Germans and Swiss have also settled there. And there we coincidentally passed a "Santa Claus Village". That is something so nice and tasteful. 4 Montreal businessmen built it. Of course, they also earn money from it, but the complex cost them 200,000 dollars. It is a large hill with about 7-8 colorful witch's houses, each containing something different. In one, Native American handicrafts are sold, in another only postcards, and in another, souvenirs. In the little chapel is the Nativity scene, and you can ring the bell and make a wish. And in one house is Santa Claus with his sleigh, and he talks to all the children and gives them candy. He spoke German with us, and told us everything about the grounds. In the garden and in the houses, goats and llamas and young bear cubs roam around, all very tame.

Toronto, October 10, 1955

Dear Mother!
The "gotteskind" arrived the day before yesterday. Many
thanks for it. I’m sorry you had such
trouble with it. But we went right away
today to copy from the roles.
I got 3 boys who helped
me. For now, we have distributed the roles
as follows: (God the Father: André); (Angel Gabriel:
Erika); (Joseph: Sigismund,); (Mary: Nicki); (Guldin-
sack: Uli,); (Innkeeper: Vera); (Herod: Manfred)
(Death: Werner); (Devil: Wolf); (Nabant: Horst Wer-
mescher); (Michel: Horst Möde); (Stoffel: Siegfried)
(Cyriak: Werner Kjar); (Melchior: Hans Dieter)
(Walthauser: Heinz); (Caspar: Reinhold). We are not yet clear
on the star singers. I am not joining them, as I
have to take over the direction and there are
more girls than boys anyway, at most the first star singer.
Next Sunday is the first rehearsal. Inge will
make the costumes. We do have good musicians
in the group. Manfred plays the piano well, as does Hans-Dieter, Klaus
(Inge's husband) plays the violin very well, as does Ellen,
Werner plays the mandolin and Reinhold plays the
recorder in addition to the accordion. André also plays the
piano very well. Uli plays the flute, but she has it

The scholars of the time, who were made in his factory, had talked a lot and hadn't thought about having caused a commotion, when in all people the feeling of loyalty cast itself, and as long as man wanted his feet on Earth, the companion was Joe, Brother Eckhard of sister. Joel was white in the face, so that Joe's sister and so childish, that the dog or Joel would not put his feet down, if he did not have on a very dark red skirt, black tight trousers, black Bellosen and also had a very small horns. The face was since the existence of the community and Joel then also had fun.

Yes, don't dwell on it! She can't forget a single part, and Inge wanted to give Father a calendar. I had the pleasure of receiving 3 sandbox pictures of myself. And they all turned out to be Jana's, and they are a bit crookedly inserted, but that's naturally due to the stupid frame. For all those who are always good at fixing things for me, it wasn't difficult. I don't live a single idle day, and yet I'm still forgetful, and I've always been that way because my job, which is always a fixed monthly thing, gives me a lot of fun; though I'd prefer a bit more time, or at home, where I still have a big setup that brings me a lot of joy. I'm writing you a letter, and I won't forget us, and she leaves me more often than I do, and now she's working for me for a month.

about 1000 meters high and resembles the Black Forest, except that the only road going through it is just a path, like perhaps the old road to Meersburg. There it was constantly up and down, up in 1st gear, down in 2nd gear; that's how steep it was. And then every 2 miles a magnificent lake. We spent the night in St. Simon; it was freezing cold there. The water in the river there is already salty. Something pleasant also happened to us there. At night we always lock the car. With the Volkswagen, you can open it from the inside, but not from the outside. In the morning, we couldn't figure out how to open the doors; the keys were on the dashboard. Coincidentally, the hood was open at the front, where the tools are. So I thought, I can surely do what the camera thieves in Toronto could. So I bent a screwdriver crooked, and in 5 minutes the window was forced open. That was our luck, because we were only in our swimsuits in the rather cold morning at 5 AM, and there are, of course, no car repair shops up there anymore. Then came a wonderful stretch, mountains and lake, all about 1000 meters high, forest and very isolated houses.

Choice. So far in Kiel, we were also in Kitchener, St. Catherines or Hamilton for peace. We will then select proceeds for the fund, for which I have already thought of something nice that we can do in the group. Optionally: we offer to ask 10 questions that they answer on a slip of paper. For example, one question is: how one gets a point for the one who has 50 points, a book. The one who has the most correct points in the evening may choose a topic. * E.g. about Napoleon or Goethe or or Geometry or Physics or Charlemagne or anything, but in such a way that everyone sits in their seat, chair or even on the floor, as the questions are asked on the following Sunday * if one prepares for the next evening. The whole thing takes only 10 minutes and why one becomes a member of the German Brotherhood. There we already get very good books for 1858. For today I want to stop and Many warm greetings Your York

Monto, Sep. 19, '55-

Dear Mother!
Just a quick note today. Mechi is currently developing photos, an order of 450 pictures, so I have to help fix them.
But now quickly, the reason I'm writing: Mechi and I have come up with the idea that we could perform 'The Christ Child' with the youth group. Would it be possible for you to send it to us by airmail? The postage is on us, we've already ordered 5 albums from Photopost anyway, so everything will go on one bill. We've already thought about the roles, but we need to start rehearsals as soon as possible.
Our trip was great, Maja's wedding too. I'm probably writing to her now. But work, so more in a few days.
Warm regards
Dork
P.S. If Bärbel sends it immediately, I'll send a reel for the Viewmaster by return post.

No health insurance, not even the most expensive private insurance, covers the dentist, presumably because otherwise it would go bankrupt. The same applies to medication, if you are not in hospital. Now that it's Health Week, great care is once again taken to ensure everyone knows about vitamins and calories. I must say, much more attention is paid to this here, and fresh apples and oranges are eaten very much, as well as much more fresh vegetables than in Germany, which can be bought at cheap prices. Much more salad is eaten, especially coleslaw and lettuce, then raw carrots (whole ones) and raw celery, raw spinach (very good) and radishes! Cucumber slices (plain) and bell peppers. Salad here is mostly eaten with the hand, something fresh with every meal. Relatively few bananas are bought, although they are so cheap, but they don't contain many vitamins and make you fat. That might seem a bit

Hilde Kocherndörfer has again put me in a very good financial position in Germany. But we weren't at all the type to stop for anything. And precisely on that day she indeed gave the last money to the last man. Everything has begun. And all the time Inge and Klaus were seeking more involvement in group life; for Klaus, that means he starts as an electrical engineer tomorrow. Until now he has worked as a draftsman. That is of course also a significant achievement and better than continent. We were with Eigris and the same one. They want to leave again on Sunday. 30 yards. Hopefully, that's 25 cents, that's $7.50, and then Bärbel came, as did Inge. We continue to rehearse, one to two times a week. Of course, but since Eigris falls into the water and it's always true. And we are dependent on our attitude, but without the will like the Killens without a fight. And now we are with her husband Fred, on Sunday, when he is available.

Honolulu July 22, 1966.

Dear Mother,
Today your letter arrived, which made me very happy. Also, Uncle Max, many thanks for that. Otherwise, I haven't received another letter, which I didn't want, as that would mean 4 or 5 days are amiss. You can believe me. It is very demanding there at Thekla's. The secretary was very agitated because something wasn't supposed to happen that quickly. Nothing was filed away anywhere on the desk in the entire hall. In any case, it's already 45-50% of the amount, which is already 800 DM per month. Good prospects. By the way, groom is 20-80$ there and over 1000 DM. Do you know what is so rare here, that a girl is truly interested and responsible, someone with whom I could also work again at our hospital. My supervisor is 34 and has done 6 years of trauma surgery. She is also very kind and has been at the hospital for 6 years. She often asks me in the evenings if I have rested, so that I am also exhausted. Yesterday I was already so exhausted, as if I had already been awake. The whole family has been working the whole time. That is unique. I have decided that I will look for a new job.

7. It was only recently that the anthropologists performed a nativity play, which was with all the bells and whistles. It was also good advertising for our group, and immediately after the play, 3 people asked if they could come. Tomorrow, Sunday School and a nativity play will take place, which we must see here. Today is the last day to send (something to) Toronto, also to write you (from) Toronto 45 more cards. Dear Mother, I hope that you can use the coffee maker. I thought that when I drive to the market in the morning, you can prepare all the coffee, and by the time you've finished all the coffee, or collected money, you'll be finished with the coffee, and it brews perfectly. I want to briefly describe the device for its operation. It's for 4, 6 or 8 cups, but not less than 4 cups. (There's a lot of coffee in it!) Then put the container back in, the coffee grounds into your coffee maker. The son agrees. He goes downstairs to do his thing. If you want, it's not necessary, as a full cup stays warmer on the coffee lid. After the lid is on and turn on the coffee.

Now Kunoach, the companion, has arrived.
Joe is the Goldinsach, Vera the watchman, a new spring.

Then Manfred again, but it doesn't bother me much to continue with God.
The children are not alone if I am not rough with them, I say, then it is properly set right now, and a misfortune happened to me with Mr. Fried, and a misfortune happened to me, and to him, the Fried before the lots. That should be for children who can't bear it with me, and with the children, I can't bear it, and Mr. Fried should not forget it.
Everyone should bring harmony. A play was performed there, it was there once too, and then the Lord God naturally took actions. What did the Lord God naturally reject? I don't really know that.
I can truly no longer say that no effort is put into pictures made behind a Schmeller who no longer values the meaning.

Once, a large brown bear almost crossed our path. He was sitting in the grass by the road, and as we drove past, he immediately turned around and trotted into the forest. Too bad, we couldn't photograph him.
In Chicoutimi, we even went to the cinema; we saw the same film as on my birthday, "Cinderella". There's a lot of timber industry everywhere there; the entire hills are full of logs, so many, I've never seen anything like it before. We took many pictures, I'll send them later.
The next day, we drove through Laurentide Park; it's a provincial park of 4000 square miles with 1600 lakes. Hunting is not allowed there, but fishing is, for salmon up to 2 meters long and a type of trout. But you can't stay there long or live there because everything to the left and right of the road is such dense primeval forest that you can't go two meters in. But we still went for a swim. The path is simply cut into the forest; the trees are still lying on the left and right. Once we had to stop because two female moose ran across the road.
