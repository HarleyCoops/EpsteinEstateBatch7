Choice. So far in Kiel, we were also in Kitchener, St. Catherines or Hamilton for peace. We will then select proceeds for the fund, for which I have already thought of something nice that we can do in the group. Optionally: we offer to ask 10 questions that they answer on a slip of paper. For example, one question is: how one gets a point for the one who has 50 points, a book. The one who has the most correct points in the evening may choose a topic. * E.g. about Napoleon or Goethe or or Geometry or Physics or Charlemagne or anything, but in such a way that everyone sits in their seat, chair or even on the floor, as the questions are asked on the following Sunday * if one prepares for the next evening. The whole thing takes only 10 minutes and why one becomes a member of the German Brotherhood. There we already get very good books for 1858. For today I want to stop and Many warm greetings Your York
