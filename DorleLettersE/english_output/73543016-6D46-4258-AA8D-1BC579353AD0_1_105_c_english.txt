7. It was only recently that the anthropologists performed a nativity play, which was with all the bells and whistles. It was also good advertising for our group, and immediately after the play, 3 people asked if they could come. Tomorrow, Sunday School and a nativity play will take place, which we must see here. Today is the last day to send (something to) Toronto, also to write you (from) Toronto 45 more cards. Dear Mother, I hope that you can use the coffee maker. I thought that when I drive to the market in the morning, you can prepare all the coffee, and by the time you've finished all the coffee, or collected money, you'll be finished with the coffee, and it brews perfectly. I want to briefly describe the device for its operation. It's for 4, 6 or 8 cups, but not less than 4 cups. (There's a lot of coffee in it!) Then put the container back in, the coffee grounds into your coffee maker. The son agrees. He goes downstairs to do his thing. If you want, it's not necessary, as a full cup stays warmer on the coffee lid. After the lid is on and turn on the coffee.
