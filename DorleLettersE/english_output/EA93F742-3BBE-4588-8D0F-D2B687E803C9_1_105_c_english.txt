Dear Mother!
The "gotteskind" arrived the day before yesterday. Many
thanks for it. I’m sorry you had such
trouble with it. But we went right away
today to copy from the roles.
I got 3 boys who helped
me. For now, we have distributed the roles
as follows: (God the Father: André); (Angel Gabriel:
Erika); (Joseph: Sigismund,); (Mary: Nicki); (Guldin-
sack: Uli,); (Innkeeper: Vera); (Herod: Manfred)
(Death: Werner); (Devil: Wolf); (Nabant: Horst Wer-
mescher); (Michel: Horst Möde); (Stoffel: Siegfried)
(Cyriak: Werner Kjar); (Melchior: Hans Dieter)
(Walthauser: Heinz); (Caspar: Reinhold). We are not yet clear
on the star singers. I am not joining them, as I
have to take over the direction and there are
more girls than boys anyway, at most the first star singer.
Next Sunday is the first rehearsal. Inge will
make the costumes. We do have good musicians
in the group. Manfred plays the piano well, as does Hans-Dieter, Klaus
(Inge's husband) plays the violin very well, as does Ellen,
Werner plays the mandolin and Reinhold plays the
recorder in addition to the accordion. André also plays the
piano very well. Uli plays the flute, but she has it
