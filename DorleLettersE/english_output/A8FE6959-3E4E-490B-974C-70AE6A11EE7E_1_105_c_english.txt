conjure up vitamins, but in the city that is really important, so all flours and milk and other foodstuffs are artificially enriched with vitamins, so that in the local cotton white bread there are actually the same vitamins as in wholemeal bread. By the way, now that I'm talking about artificial things, here there is now a Saccharine (sweetener), which cannot by any stretch of the imagination be distinguished from sugar. We use it in the hospital for our diabetic patients and the gentlemen on a diet. It is also very cheap, but sugar costs nothing here anyway, $10 a pound. We have also written to the Betzels again; since I left, they have made 8 1/2 Morgen of young plantings, mostly on leased land. Mr. Betzel does everything on Type 9 or now Type 4 with an iron pipe framework. A 20-year lease is sufficient, because then the soil is exhausted and the plants would fail. That is modern. It would almost ruin the farmers. But he has success with it. Best regards. Törle.
