Dear Mother,
Today your letter arrived, which made me very happy. Also, Uncle Max, many thanks for that. Otherwise, I haven't received another letter, which I didn't want, as that would mean 4 or 5 days are amiss. You can believe me. It is very demanding there at Thekla's. The secretary was very agitated because something wasn't supposed to happen that quickly. Nothing was filed away anywhere on the desk in the entire hall. In any case, it's already 45-50% of the amount, which is already 800 DM per month. Good prospects. By the way, groom is 20-80$ there and over 1000 DM. Do you know what is so rare here, that a girl is truly interested and responsible, someone with whom I could also work again at our hospital. My supervisor is 34 and has done 6 years of trauma surgery. She is also very kind and has been at the hospital for 6 years. She often asks me in the evenings if I have rested, so that I am also exhausted. Yesterday I was already so exhausted, as if I had already been awake. The whole family has been working the whole time. That is unique. I have decided that I will look for a new job.
