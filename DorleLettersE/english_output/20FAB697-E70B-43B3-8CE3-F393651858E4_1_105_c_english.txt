about 1000 meters high and resembles the Black Forest, except that the only road going through it is just a path, like perhaps the old road to Meersburg. There it was constantly up and down, up in 1st gear, down in 2nd gear; that's how steep it was. And then every 2 miles a magnificent lake. We spent the night in St. Simon; it was freezing cold there. The water in the river there is already salty. Something pleasant also happened to us there. At night we always lock the car. With the Volkswagen, you can open it from the inside, but not from the outside. In the morning, we couldn't figure out how to open the doors; the keys were on the dashboard. Coincidentally, the hood was open at the front, where the tools are. So I thought, I can surely do what the camera thieves in Toronto could. So I bent a screwdriver crooked, and in 5 minutes the window was forced open. That was our luck, because we were only in our swimsuits in the rather cold morning at 5 AM, and there are, of course, no car repair shops up there anymore. Then came a wonderful stretch, mountains and lake, all about 1000 meters high, forest and very isolated houses.
