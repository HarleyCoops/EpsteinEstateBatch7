Dear Mother and Siblings!
How are you all doing? Hopefully you are now again devoting more time to yourselves; hopefully there is still opportunity because of school. I am again in school every evening this week. Previously [I was] in typing and shorthand. And Sunday is youth evening and then I am writing work. In the summer I sometimes had a bad conscience when I wrote about your workers and I went swimming at 3 o'clock after work. I will not that to myself anymore, but I will not keep the plans. Everyone writes, which I believe I still found from 5 school cards. The pen I don't hold when listing with x against an advantage. And all this here, where one can write a bullet so easily. And all that gets one through the week; then the week starts with such a small Bin given as a gift, and Topfloppen, form cakes from do you know what I did today?
