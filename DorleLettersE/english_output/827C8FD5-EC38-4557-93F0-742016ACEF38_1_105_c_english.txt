Dear Mother!
Just a quick note today. Mechi is currently developing photos, an order of 450 pictures, so I have to help fix them.
But now quickly, the reason I'm writing: Mechi and I have come up with the idea that we could perform 'The Christ Child' with the youth group. Would it be possible for you to send it to us by airmail? The postage is on us, we've already ordered 5 albums from Photopost anyway, so everything will go on one bill. We've already thought about the roles, but we need to start rehearsals as soon as possible.
Our trip was great, Maja's wedding too. I'm probably writing to her now. But work, so more in a few days.
Warm regards
Dork
P.S. If Bärbel sends it immediately, I'll send a reel for the Viewmaster by return post.
