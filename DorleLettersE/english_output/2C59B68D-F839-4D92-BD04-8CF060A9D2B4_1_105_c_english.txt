and then small gatherings, like 'appetizers'.
I had baked a beautiful buttercream cake, piped with roses and pansies on it. The youth group had given Inge a beautiful tea set, which was immediately inaugurated. Then we set off for Woodview, where the two stayed, and Manfred and I drove on. That was quite a nice stretch to drive, over 300 miles (480 km); at midnight we arrived at the others' place in Baysville.

Inge's sister Hilde is doing well in Germany; she is not working yet but will soon start at an American office in Wiesbaden. She spent the entire summer traveling with her father, in Holland and Belgium and in Italy.
Our new apartment is very nice; we now have more space, but we also have proportionally more visitors. Sometimes half the group is here. You ask about Christmas wishes. I would really like an anorak for skiing with a hood, preferably blue. Or accessories, a camping stove. For small items, I would like a case for filters and a sun visor, to attach to the strap, or a wash bag.

or I would like a nice thick blanket.
I would like to wish you and your parents a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Yours, Inge
