Yes, don't dwell on it! She can't forget a single part, and Inge wanted to give Father a calendar. I had the pleasure of receiving 3 sandbox pictures of myself. And they all turned out to be Jana's, and they are a bit crookedly inserted, but that's naturally due to the stupid frame. For all those who are always good at fixing things for me, it wasn't difficult. I don't live a single idle day, and yet I'm still forgetful, and I've always been that way because my job, which is always a fixed monthly thing, gives me a lot of fun; though I'd prefer a bit more time, or at home, where I still have a big setup that brings me a lot of joy. I'm writing you a letter, and I won't forget us, and she leaves me more often than I do, and now she's working for me for a month.
