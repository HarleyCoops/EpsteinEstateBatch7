Everyone has a different opinion on how they should play their roles this time. So I have to say, it was good, even though it was different from what I remembered. I admit it, because it is then more believable. I find it better if we play it naturally than (how it is in) the Herodes scene. For example, it's somewhat different from when we played it; Herodes does not point to the throne, he is not so prominent at the beginning, and the Herodes scene is also constantly being revised. Of course, I want to try (to understand) what has been changed, it's a shame. It has been changed. Heinz is also very good as Wallmann and Gerhart too, and Josef is always there, and also such a little Josef, but Herrina can (handle) Josef. The hall is also quite something. Joe has already learned a lot, especially regarding how he handles his initial routines in each scene; after playing it well a couple of times, he almost doesn't need to play it anymore. Friedel Stoffel is also good. I really believe it will work out. It's on the 3rd Advent evening, and we have already sent out invitations.
