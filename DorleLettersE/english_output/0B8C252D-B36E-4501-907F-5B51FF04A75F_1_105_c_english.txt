where one registers, time and date, and at the exit, one is checked to ensure one hasn't hunted. That was a great tour. Then we went across the Laurentians to Shawinigan Falls and St. Jerome. From there we drove up the highway into the High Laurentians, again over 1000 meters high, but not as wild, more like Allgäu, with proper Allgäu-style houses. Many Germans and Swiss have also settled there. And there we coincidentally passed a "Santa Claus Village". That is something so nice and tasteful. 4 Montreal businessmen built it. Of course, they also earn money from it, but the complex cost them 200,000 dollars. It is a large hill with about 7-8 colorful witch's houses, each containing something different. In one, Native American handicrafts are sold, in another only postcards, and in another, souvenirs. In the little chapel is the Nativity scene, and you can ring the bell and make a wish. And in one house is Santa Claus with his sleigh, and he talks to all the children and gives them candy. He spoke German with us, and told us everything about the grounds. In the garden and in the houses, goats and llamas and young bear cubs roam around, all very tame.
