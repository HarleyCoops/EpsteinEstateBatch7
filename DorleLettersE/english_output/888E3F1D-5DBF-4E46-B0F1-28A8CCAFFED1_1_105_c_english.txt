Vancouver, July 31, 1955
Dear Dorli and Meddi!
Many thanks for your beautiful and heartfelt greeting!
Homeward journey – the weather, despite a short, light rain, can now be described as mild – I received my mail after the third day, now all the ship business is done and I am going tomorrow morning with a friend to Toronto, where I will stay until Tuesday. Incoming mail and the letters remained with G. Bell.
