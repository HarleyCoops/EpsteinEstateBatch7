  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reason": "The letter starts with 'Toronto, den 10.10.55' and 'Liebe Mutter!'. It discusses the arrival of the 'gotteskind' script (requested in L0002) and the casting for the play. The following pages continue the narrative, discussing evening classes, a Sunday hike, the wedding of 'Inge und Klaus', and finally asking for Christmas gifts. The content is consistent and flows logically across the four pages."
