Dear Mother!
Just a quick note today, mecki is developing pictures, an order for 450 of them, so I have to help with the fixing.
But now, quickly, to the reason I'm writing: mecki and I thought that we could perform the "Gotteskind" with the youth group. Would it be possible for you to send it to us by airmail? We'll cover the postage; we've ordered 5 albums from Photopost anyway, so it can all go on one bill. We've already thought about the roles, but we need to start rehearsals as soon as possible.
Our trip was great, the wedding of ... he was too, I'm just writing during work, so more on that in a few days.
Warm regards,
Dork
P.S. If Bärbel sends it right away, I'll send a reel for the View-Master by return mail.

Dear Mother!
The "Gotteskind" arrived the day before yesterday. Many thanks for it. I'm sorry you had such a hassle with it. But we got right to copying the parts today; I got 3 boys to help me. For now, we've assigned the roles like this: (God the Father: André); (Angel Gabriel: Erika); (Joseph: Sigismund); (Mary: Nicki); (Guldinsach: Uli); (Innkeeper's Wife: Vera); (Herod: Manfred); (Death: Werner); (Devil: Wolf); (Attendant: Horst Wermescher); (Michel: Horst Miele); (Stoffel: Siegfried); (Cyrich: Werner Kjarr); (Melchior: Hans Dieter); (Walthauser: Heinz); (Caspar: Reinhold). We're not yet sure about the star singers. I'm not acting in it, since I have to take on the directing and there are more girls than roles anyway, maybe the first star singer at most.
Next Sunday is the first rehearsal. Inge wants to make the costumes. We do, however, have good musicians in the group. Manfred plays piano well, as does Hans-Dieter, Klaus (Inge's husband) plays the violin very well, Ellen too, Werner plays mandolin and Reinhold plays the recorder in addition to the accordion. André also plays the piano very well. Uli plays the transverse flute, but she doesn't have it with her. I was just at Sigismund's and showed him the script. He had some concerns about whether we could get the pronunciation right, since everyone except Reinhold is actually German. But I think we should try it in any case. I want to see if we can fill a whole evening with the play and with choirs and musical performances.
It's a lot of work, having to take care of everything, especially since I'm overbooked with night school again. I have pottery again (where I'm now on the electric wheel), then gymnastics (mecki now goes once a week too), and then shorthand and typing. In shorthand and typing, you always have to do homework too. By the way, was Ernst serious about the secretary position at Uncle Max's? That would really be some job. I'd certainly be interested in that.
Yesterday, on Sunday, we set off in three cars at 4 in the morning because we wanted to go on a hike. We drove to Collingwood on Georgian Bay and climbed around in caves and rock crevices there, and took excursions through the woods. It was so beautifully sunny and
