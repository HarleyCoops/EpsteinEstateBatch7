You know, last year the Anthroposophists put on a nativity play, it was with all the bells and whistles, it was also good advertising for our group, and right after the play 3 people asked if they could come join. Tomorrow the Sunday school is putting on a nativity play, so of course we have to go and watch it.

Today is the last day to send cards and letters, for Toronto too, and I still have to write 45 cards.
Dear Mutti, I hope you can use the coffee maker. I was thinking, when you drive to the market in the morning, you can turn everything on, and by the time you've washed up in bed, or are having breakfast, the coffee will be ready.
The brew that you get from the coffee grounds still makes 4, 6, or 8 cups, but not less than 4 cups (you'll have to experiment!). Then you put the necessary number of spoonfuls of coffee into the coffee container, and fill the coffee pot with the specified number of cups of water. You will see that there is a hole at the bottom of the filter, but it doesn't need to get wet. Then put the lid on and plug the cord in. That's all. The coffee stirs itself and stops on its own when it's done. Then enough heat remains in the pot that it doesn't get too cold, but also not so much that you have to worry about the coffee boiling over. If you want to keep the coffee warm for the next day or so, you have to put it in with the coffee container, just without it, and make sure the coffee is not too hot. If you feel there is only a little water on the outside, because of the hearts in it, then take the lid off so it can get some air.
The socks and all the sweaters I made myself, it's so simple. If you ever have a problem with it, write to me. For Grecel, the clothes hanger is for when she doesn't have a wardrobe, for brushing clothes and so on. For Christel it is still a bit big, but it will fit soon.

Now, many heartfelt Christmas greetings and a happy New Year to you all from Drk.
