Dodo i. Idowdo, J..(?) District Saturday, 27 Aug. 66.
Dear Mother,
Today your letter arrived with the one from
Uncle Max. Many thanks for it, so that
with your other letter, I didn't want
it to be that 4 or 5 days
had gone by. The cards are also
included. I'll write to you with an answer
as soon as I have one.
The salary for a secretary varies a lot,
as soon as I have an answer I'll write to you
but they usually start from
450-500 DM. That's
already 800 Dlb. a month. well paid
other districts get 20-30 Dlb. more
are over 1000 DM. you know, here
it's rare that a girl is really
interested and takes on responsibility,
I notice that at our hospital, too.
my supervisor is 34 years old
and has been at the hospital for 6 years.
she often asks me in the evenings if she can go to a
, then I go to the
patients by myself and nothing has ever happened
now it's as if she's jealous, or
envious, that's why she often starts arguments,
really for no reason, then I tell her
off again, and things are fine again.
