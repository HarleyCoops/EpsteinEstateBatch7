Dear Dorli and Mucki!
Vancouver, July 31, 55

My journey home has just begun - Westward. Despite some terrible weather, not to say - lousy weather, I have nonetheless had some wonderful days.
Just too short, as I have my ship booked for today.
When I woke up this morning, it was raining and today it is still living and laughing. I will carefully take care of the contributions and the orders.
Your Gretel

Miss
