Dear Gretl and Mucki!
Vancouver, July 31, '55

Many greetings and our very
best wishes for your
journey home - We can't say
when you'll be reading this little card - I am doing
very well and am refreshed after some
wonderful days.
This is too short, since one
is writing for you. I hope
to receive a few lines from you
next, and better pictures
too.
Many greetings and the warmest
regards to all our acquaintances.
Your Grete.
