  "reason": "This group seems to be a single letter, but the pages were also assigned to other letters with higher confidence. The theme of health, diet (vitamins), and dental care connects these pages. The first page mentions bad teeth in Canada, the second discusses the local diet, and the third continues on vitamins and is signed 'Dorle'. It's possible these are fragments from one letter, but the other groupings are stronger."
