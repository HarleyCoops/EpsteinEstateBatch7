Toronto, November 19, 1955

Dear Mom and siblings,
How are you all? I have more time again in the evenings now, hopefully always because of school. I’m back in evening school for a week now, for typing and shorthand. I felt a bit guilty when you wrote about your work and I was done with my work at 3 o’clock. Please excuse that I’m writing like this, but I’m using a fountain pen with a nib that I think dates back to the last century, which I found in a lovely old box. The fountain pen has one of those grips with indentations for your fingers, which I’m not used to. And on top of all that, my ballpoint pen on the left side here has run out. I absolutely have to start again. This week I'll start with the names. I was also given a box of pears, a ball of yarn, potholders, and cookie cutters in the shape of bones. And do you know what I did today? That Banti is there too, even though she doesn’t speak English well. The shorthand isn’t difficult for me, it just goes far too slowly in school.

On Monday we have another performance, this time for "National Health Week." We’ve practiced new things for it, which are rope skipping, rope jumping, and hoops. It’s really great fun. I think we’ve already gotten some real muscles from it. The other exercises are more or less done sitting down. It’s all the best kind of directing and training. For a change, we’re also playing a bit of "Contrasts to 'Love Beethoven'" and "Time We Had." I don’t like the coffee here enough for them to be able to get me to drink it. They stay there firmly and can’t be closed. Just take a look at them (the ones I sent back) and then decide. They cost $13, which is 52 DM. But if you can bring something for a third person or something else, though not things that are too expensive, which are then free, maybe we could arrange it so that the money could come from me.

No health insurance, not even the most expensive private insurance, covers the dentist, presumably because they would otherwise go bankrupt. The same goes for medication, if you’re not in the hospital. Now that it’s Health Week, there’s a lot of emphasis again on making sure everyone knows about vitamins and calories. I have to say, they pay much more attention to that here, and fresh apples and oranges are eaten a lot, as are a lot more fresh vegetables than in Germany, which can be bought at cheap prices. A lot more salad is eaten, especially coleslaw and lettuce, then raw carrots (just whole like that) and raw celery, raw spinach (very good), and radishes, cucumber slices (plain), and bell peppers. Salad here is generally eaten with your hands, and there’s something fresh with every meal. So, comparatively few bananas are bought, even though they are so cheap, but they don’t have many vitamins in them and are so fattening.

This might all seem exaggerated to you, robbing things of all their vitamins, but in the city it’s really important. For example, all flours and milk and other foods are artificially enriched with vitamins, so that the local cotton-white bread actually has the same vitamins as whole-grain bread. By the way, speaking of artificial things, there’s a saccharine here (sweetener) that, with the best will in the world, is indistinguishable from sugar. We use it in the hospital for our diabetics and for weight-loss diets. It’s also very cheap, but sugar costs nothing here anyway, 10¢ a pound.

The Betzels have written to me again. Since I left, they have planted 8-12 acres of young plants, mostly on leased land. Mr. Betzel does everything on Type 9 or now Type 4 rootstock with iron pipe trellises. A 20-year lease is enough for that, because by then the soil is depleted and the planting is declining. That’s modern, almost like the farmers do it here. But he’s having success with it.

Warm regards,
Dorle
