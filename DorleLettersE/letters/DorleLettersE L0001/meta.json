  "reason": "This letter describes a road trip. Page 1 (7F6DD828...) starts in Mont Laurier on July 12, 55, mentioning Quebec and the St. Lawrence River. Page 2 (20FAB697...) continues the travelogue, describing steep roads, a lake in St. Simeon, and getting locked out of the car. Page 3 (C18F0088...) describes seeing a bear, Chicoutimi, and the Laurentide Park. Page 4 (0B8C252D...) continues the description of the park and a visit to 'Santa Claus Village'. The flow of the travel narrative is clear and consistent across these pages."
