Monto, Sept. 19, 55

Dear Mother,
Just a very quick note today, mecki is making
pictures right now, an order for 450 photos, so
I have to help with the fixing.
But now quickly to the reason I'm writing:
mecki and I thought that
we could perform "Gotteskind" with the
youth group. Would it be possible
for you to send it to us by airmail? The
postage will be on us; we've already
ordered 5 albums from Photopost anyway, so
everything will go on one bill. We have already
thought about the roles, but we need to
start rehearsals as soon as possible.
Our trip was great, and so was
...’s wedding. I'm writing this while
working, so more
in a few days.
Warm regards,
Dork
P.S. If bärbel sends it right away,
I'll send a reel for
the View-Master by return mail.
