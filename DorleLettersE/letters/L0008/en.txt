Dear Gretl and Mucki!
Vancouver, July 31, 55

My son has set off on his
journey home—westward. Despite
terrible weather,
not to say—lousy weather,
I've had some wonderful days,
just too short, as one
is shipping out. Very many
greetings to you all and also especially
warm greetings to the grandparents.
Your Gretl
