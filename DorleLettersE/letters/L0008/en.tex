Dodo in Idowdo, Trebnitz District
Sunday, May 22, 66.
Dear Mother,
Your letter with the one from Uncle Max arrived today. Thank you very much for it, and also for your other letter.
I didn't want to, since about 4 or 5 days have passed. The cards are also included. First, let me know if secretaries are in high demand, or if I can get by just fine as a mother's help.
There's a job opening here for an office worker, 45-50 pounds a week, which is already 800 DM a month. Well-paid also in the rest of the district, typists 70-80 pounds, that's over 1000 DM. You know, here it's rare that a girl is really interested and takes on responsibility, I notice that at the hospital. My supervisor is 34, has been working in the hospital secretariat for 6 1/2 years and has been at the hospital for 6 years. She often asks me in the evenings if she, when I leave, hardly goes out. I want to get it done and it's often as strenuous for me as if I were taking my final school exams.
Fungis, who is getting married soon, she's not a secretary, she's 22 and has no clue. Bank, and so on.
