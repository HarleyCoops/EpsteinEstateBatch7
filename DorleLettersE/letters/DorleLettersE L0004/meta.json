  "reason": "The letter begins with 'Toronto, den 19.11.55' and 'Liebe Mutti und Geschwister!'. The first page discusses evening school (typewriter and shorthand). The second page continues this topic and mentions a performance for 'National Health Week'. The third page expands on the health theme, discussing vitamins and diet in Canada. The fourth page discusses the lack of health insurance ('Krankenkasse') and the weather. The final page continues the topic of diet (vitamins) and closes with 'Herzlichen gruß. Dorle'. The thematic progression is consistent, linking school, health, and life in Canada."
