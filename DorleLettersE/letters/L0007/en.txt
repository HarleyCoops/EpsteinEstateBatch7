Toronto, January 3, 1956

Dear Uncle Max,

I know it's been a long time since I last wrote to you. But I'm sure you've heard from Grandma what I've been up to here, and that I'm doing well.
I'll get right to the point without a long preamble. Mother wrote to me that you're looking for someone to take some of the work off your hands and lighten your load. I don't know what your requirements are or if I would be up to them, but the work would appeal to me—handling your correspondence and helping out wherever I could.
I've taken a shorthand and typing course here, and I'll be looking for an office job in the spring anyway. Although I did have a lot of office work to do as a dietitian's assistant these past two years, I would much rather work my way up to being a secretary. I believe that would be a profession that would satisfy and fulfill me.
How about a trial period? Then I would have just taken a vacation from Canada for a while, and I could always come back.
Dear Uncle Max, please don't think that I'm building castles in the air and that I'll be terribly unhappy if nothing comes of it. This was just an attempt, a job application, and I've learned here that you don't always have immediate success with those. You just have to keep looking. But I just wanted to tell you that I would have been happy to do it; it would be a real purpose.

Warm regards,

Your Dorle
