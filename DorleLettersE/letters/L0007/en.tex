Dolo in Idowdo, District of J..[unreadable] Thursday, Sept. 22, '66.
Dear Mother,
Today your letter arrived with the one from
Uncle Max. Many thanks for it, and also
for your other letter.
I didn't want you to be so
worried. The matter with the
board notice Theobald gets
secretariat association very quickly
and whether Theobald has mail yet
or whether the letter is just arriving.
So, we'll wait and see. The mail here is very
slow, it's in transit for 45-50 days, that's
already 800 D-Marks a month. well insured
other districts get 20-30 shipments
are over 1000 pounds. You know here
it's rare for a girl to be truly
interested and take responsibility,
I notice that at the
hospital. my supervisor is 34 years old
and has been at the hospital for 6 years.
she often asks me in the evening if she can
come along for the occasional beer.
I have to stand there, fully dressed,
until she has found her clothes.
long story short, she's getting married soon, that's
the only thing that interests her.
So, now I'll close. Many greetings
from me and Theobald.
Your son,
Walter
