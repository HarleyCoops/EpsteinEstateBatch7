  "reason": "This letter, dated July 12, 1955, from Mont Laurier, describes a road trip. The pages follow a clear geographical and narrative progression: starting the trip from Montreal to Quebec, driving through the mountains, visiting Laurentide Park, and then the Laurentians and Santa Claus Village. The content flows seamlessly from one page to the next."
