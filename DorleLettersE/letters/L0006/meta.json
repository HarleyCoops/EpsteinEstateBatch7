  "reason": "This letter begins with a date of Dec 26, 1955. It thanks the recipient for a Christmas package (Anorak), describes Christmas Eve celebrations, and discusses plans for New Year's and the resumption of evening school on Jan 4. The final page continues the school topic and ends with a closing and signature. The chronological flow and consistent themes of post-Christmas life tie these pages together."
