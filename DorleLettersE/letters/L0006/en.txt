Toronto, January 3, 1956

Dear Uncle Max,

I know, it’s been a long time since I last wrote to you. But I’m sure you’ve heard from Grandma what I’ve been up to here, and that I’m doing well.
I’ll get right to the point without a long preamble. Mother wrote to me that you’re looking for someone to take some of the work off your hands and lighten your load. I don’t know what your requirements are or whether I would be up to them, but the work of handling your correspondence and helping wherever I could would appeal to me.
I’ve taken a shorthand and typing course here, and I’ll be looking for a position in an office this spring anyway. Although I’ve had to do a lot of office work these past two years as a dietitian's assistant, I would much rather work my way up to being a secretary; I believe that would be a profession that would satisfy and fulfill me.
How about a trial period? Then I would have simply taken a vacation from Canada for a while, and could always come back.
Dear Uncle Max, please don’t think that I’m building castles in the air and that I’ll be terribly unhappy if nothing comes of it. This was just an attempt, a job application, and I’ve learned here that you don’t always have immediate success with those. You just keep looking. But I just want to tell you that I would have been happy to do it; it would be a real task.

Warm regards,

Your Dorle
