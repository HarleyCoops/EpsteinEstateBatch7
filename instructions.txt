1. This repo has an existing set of code that will process images and extract text. 
2. We are going to make a different version of this model within the folder/StoryTranslator.
3. Story translator will have an input folder and an output folder.
4. The input folder will have a set of images that we want to translate.
5. The output folder will have a set of text files that are the translated text from the images but the twist is the source document will be handwrittten and in german. 
6. Therefore we might have two output: each handwritten image will be extract into the original text german first. 
7. From that markdown file in german, the model will translate it into english. 
8. The final output will be a markdown file in english.
