Toronto, Dec. 13th.

Dear Bärbel!
Just a quick, hurried letter before Christmas. I was just reading, because I wanted to tell you that the holiday program here is in the evening on the 21st, 22nd, or 23rd of Dec. That's when our church will be decorated and gifts will be distributed. I know that all the children in Germany don't report exactly what they saw. It is assumed it was recorded from a shortwave transmitter; a lot from the Montreal Hospital, it's from them. In our free time, and partly during work time, we are making lots of things for Dietchen. For the Eber family we have crocheted 600 sponges, that is, cotton batting with thread, a scarf with red buttons. Then we made little Christmas trees out of paper and Santa Clauses.
But I won't have such a bad Christmas, I'm used to it.
It's even a double holiday, where one doesn't have half the day off. I have 5 days off for New Year's. Then it will be time to work hard again and celebrate after Christmas and New Year's.
On Christmas Eve, after the church service where I'll be singing, there will be a Christmas party for single people, put on by the Protestant women, which will surely be nice. It's like this: out of our reclusiveness and into the basement.

Now, give my best regards to everyone again, and I hope they won't be cross with me for not having written to all of them anymore. Thank you very much for your letter; Christel wrote me one too.
I haven't told you, and Ursel either, that I only sent pictures to Mother for myself. I myself haven't yet

Warm Christmas greetings,
Yours,
Gretel
