  "reason": "A Christmas-themed letter. The first page (Dec 13) is to 'Bärbel' and discusses Christmas preparations. The second page continues the Christmas theme, mentioning a church service and a party for single people, and signs off with 'Herzliche Weihnachtsgrüße Eure Gretel'. The sender and recipient seem to differ, but the strong thematic link suggests they belong together, possibly as a letter with sections for different family members."
