1953 Toronto, Jan 22

Dear Mother!
That was quite a surprise
when I came home from the
office & received a small package
and even more books.
Now from that series I have
"Der Zauberfaden", "Honigfischer",
"Der Favorit der Königin", "Am
dunklen Fluß", "Das große
Gehen", "Der [?] Erfolgreiche",
"Königin Elisabeth und" "Schicksal" "Mayer-
ling".
Now I can await
next winter with the fear
of the Chinese
B.Wördelhoff and Hall.
I often love my books
more than a circle of acquaintances.
I have had to do a lot of
painting again, but still
not so much that we could
afford the things where you get into
a wider circle.
That's the literary crowd. Up at the parsonage,
although there's nothing of the
parson to be seen, on the
outside you wouldn't know it at all.
There are always about
30 people there. One
after another, someone
recites from a poet.
Afterwards there is
coffee and you dance
wonderfully. That is something
I missed in vain in St. Katharinen,
in such a
circle of experts,
such parties just for
Going to the club, you
could get in there, but
not to parties like this.
Warmest greetings
And many thanks
for the sanitary napkins.
Doris
