\noindent
This worry about the household, it's just unbelievable. I only meant well, I was just thinking of a home for the little ones, but I see I was thinking too much like an American. I completely forgot to thank you for the letter, which was for my birthday, it just wasn't very birthday-like.

The birthday package from the Gessens arrived a week ago already. I went ahead and opened it this evening because I wanted to thank you for it. I've already started reading the Margaret book. Thank you so much for it, now I have quite a collection of books again, 9 novels, which I often lend out; plus a little something from every subject. I still really love to read. Grandma also sent me a book by Hamsun, “Victoria,” which is also very beautiful. And the book from Christel and Bärbel is of course wonderful too. Everyone who comes over looks at it. I now have 13 volumes of my encyclopedia, which I also really enjoy.

How was the family reunion?
