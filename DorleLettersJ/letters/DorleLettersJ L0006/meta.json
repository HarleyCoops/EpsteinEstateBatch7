  "reason": "These pages form a letter thanking someone for a birthday gift (a blanket and pillow). The letter discusses books received, work at a hospital ('Dietitians'), and social events ('Graduationsball'). The postscript from 'Dein Karl' on page 0D1B77E3-E407-4F82-839E-6147A323D4B0 adds a birthday wish, connecting the theme. The topics of work and books flow logically across the pages."
