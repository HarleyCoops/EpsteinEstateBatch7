Toronto, March 10th

Dear Christel,
I wish you a very happy birthday. I can hardly imagine that you're already turning 16, because I still picture you the way you were 4 years ago. The week before I left for Canada, I didn't see much of you. Have you started dancing lessons yet? Or are you not that interested in that sort of thing? Are you really getting out of school for Easter already? I wish you all the best for your apprenticeship. But you know, that thing about always keeping your journal up to date, I know how that goes. Do you really think we didn't say the same thing? I'd like to see an apprentice who doesn't have to catch up on their entries. Well, the green dress is for you to wear to work. I had brought it with me from Germany, but never wore it since it's too big for me. I only wore it a couple of times so it wouldn't be considered new. You might be able to wear some of the other dresses for work, and if not, just throw them away. They're just lying around here. Things are much more practical here. People wear pants to work in summer and winter. It's much more practical. The yellow scarf is for you too. I suppose I'll be waiting until I'm a grandmother for that English letter from you. Well, I'm not surprised about that. But Bärbel's letter was really very good.

Last Sunday I was in Welland with the Burgers and we looked at a farm they want to buy. On the way, our car got stuck in the mud; we looked like pigs afterwards. But it was lovely all the same. Well, I'll be there often in the summer.

Now, I wish you all the best again and a happy start to your apprenticeship.

Warm regards,
Dorle.
