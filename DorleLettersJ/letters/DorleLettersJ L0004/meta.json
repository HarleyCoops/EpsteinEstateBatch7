  "reason": "A letter from 'Woodview' dated Aug 14, 1954, addressed to 'Mutti'. The sender describes being on vacation with 'Inge' in a cottage by a lake. The pages describe their activities, the nature around them (poison ivy), and news from their youth group, creating a continuous narrative. Page 2E3FD556-03EA-4532-AD29-A7264B2B13D7 is chosen as the start over the nearly identical B4A9C3DC-8D10-4268-86BB-9AE48611FA51 due to a slightly more logical sentence flow at the end."
