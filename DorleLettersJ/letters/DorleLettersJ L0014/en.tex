Heartfelt birthday
wishes
for your birthday
from
Klara

Dear Christel, for this birthday,
which for you also means the end of your
school days, I wish you especially
good luck! May you have a truly
joyful celebration. It's nice that
you still have a younger companion
in Dagmar. I hope you two get along well.
Warmest greetings and good wishes from
your Grandma.
