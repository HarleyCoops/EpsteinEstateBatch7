  "reason": "A letter from Toronto dated Sept 10, 1954, to 'Michi'. The first page mentions sending a photo of the youth group and starts describing the members. The second page continues the description of the people in the photo ('Hilde Kochendörfer', 'Horst', etc.) and other group activities. The flow is perfect."
