Toronto, Dec. 11th. 53

Dear Father,
First, please excuse me for writing in
ballpoint pen, but I don't have any more ink
in the house, and it's evening now.
How are you? I hope you're well.
It's not that long until Christmas.
You're very well off, having had so
long, 13 weeks, free. You
can get a lot done. How was
the harvest? Hopefully good.
Now I'll write a little about
my work, and things aren't
so good there, because it rained
half the time. A lot of the fruit was rotten.
My work will also be finished much
sooner, since it wasn't a busy season.
I've already plowed half the farm.
On the weekend, I was in Toronto for the
first time. We went
to the "Royal Agricultural Winter Fair."
It was a very large exhibition.
Mostly, they had horses and cattle
on display. DL 6 played against the Jack Tariffs
two weeks ago, but
they lost 6-0. They won against the Hamilton
Tiger Cats. It's just
typical that I couldn't get
tickets. We just slaughtered
our turkey so that
we can let him or her age properly.
