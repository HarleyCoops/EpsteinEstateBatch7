I feel very comfortable in my new room in Toronto. It's so
nice and cozy. The refrigerator is a
great help, and I often bake something.
Medi will surely find friends in our group,
there are so many different girls
and boys, and yet a real
camaraderie, similar to how it must have been
in the Wandervogel back in the day. The fact
that they are all on their own with Mutti
brings everyone closer together, because
there are no other influences like from
parents or anything. What I really [like?] here is
when newcomers arrive, how they find their
place and join in. Medi could then take over
the photography group. You see,
many people here brought really good
cameras with them, partly as
an investment, and now they can't do
anything with them. Werner, our current leader,
probably knows a lot about photography,
he has a Leica, but he can't really
explain it well. I'm very much looking forward to Medi,
it's about time that I get back
in touch with all of you through her.
It's been so long, and so much has been new.
So much so that I can no longer picture myself at home.
You will be less [concerned?] about Medi's

Happy Birthday
