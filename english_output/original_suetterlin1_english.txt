In the East, Oct. 22, 1943
My dear Mutti and Rosi!
I have some peace again, and I think I'll use it to
wait for word from you both again, [about] what I unfortunately
don't get from home, and how you are
both doing. Just as you think, so
do I. I'm writing for now for
the day, because I don't know about an
earlier letter yet, and I'm just waiting
for another day when I
might get mail again.
