My dear Mommy and Rosi!
I have some quiet again and so I am think-
ing of you both again and I hope
you are also still doing perfectly
well. Just as you think, so
I think too. I have now written to
Karl, because otherwise I really don't
know anything else and I am waiting now
for another day when I will
get mail from you again.
