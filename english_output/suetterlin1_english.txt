In the East, 22.10.43
My dear Mutti and Rosi!
I have peace again and I am just now think-
ing of you both again and I hope
that you health-wise and also otherwise
are doing well. Just as I imagine it, so
am I too. I have now written mail to
Mary, because I know from
before [it/mail] doesn't get through, and I wait here now
for another letter from you
and will receive my mail.
