Toronto, Feb. 24, '55
Dear Mother!
I want to apologize for my letter, I am sorry. I had indeed thought too selfishly then. I will certainly not do that again. It may well be that I clearly concealed everything back then. One shouldn't just send off bad or unpleasant things right away, but wait until everything has cooled down a bit. I didn't know that my Christmas letter, which I had sent before Michi, hadn't arrived, so please apologize again. Please don't think that I was like that when we, the Eber children, had it. And when I suggested back then whether you all wouldn't want to come, it wasn't so much because you would have it easier then, nor because I felt guilty about it, as I had actually promised to come back. I had firmly decided that back then in Germany; at Betzel's I also liked the outdoor work, by the way, still do today. What can I help it if I like it so much here. At the beginning, I resisted this thought often enough & I haven't really talked about it yet whether it's advisable for you all to come over, except that we calculated it.

You were, perhaps I'll be allowed to do training on our floor, that would be my dream. But it's not possible yet. Because I don't just put any flowers on her desk, I always put a few nice ones together for her, and she's always so happy about it. It's really the nicest and most important thing when you get along so well with your boss. I can take my days off whenever I want, even if I want to leave earlier, it's always allowed. Last Saturday I had so many overtime hours to do, I told her about it, and she gave me the afternoon off, which I actually wouldn't have had until next week. But I will also never lie to her, that would go against my principles, although it's done so much. Doris also said I should just say I had to go to the dentist, but that was outrageous, for her to be like that towards me. She already told me about Down There, she was there last year too. She wants to go to Europe next year, then she'll have to visit me, that would be nice. - By the way, you'll naturally also get some of the pictures from the party, I also want to send a few to Lehmann, it might be of interest. I think it's nice that I was allowed to see that, actually only

She could have also stopped working a bit earlier next spring and then traveled via B.C. and California to Europe. In that position, she would have had every Sunday off and every second weekend from Friday to Tuesday. And that certainly would have been interesting work. She also said that wasn't enough, $40 a week. That's an hourly wage of $1.00, and back then I worked on the farm for 35¢ an hour and thought, wow, what I was saving and earning. But that's another matter.
Yes, Hilde and Mrs. Kochen are allowed to return on July 1st. Hilde had business school in Germany, so she's actually professionally suited for this bank, while Inge trained as a textile technician at the textile school and also sewed and co-designed costumes and dresses for a film studio in Wiesbaden for 3 years. For Hilde, the adjustment won't be as drastic, because she will be living in better circumstances in Germany again than here; she's just dreading the long working hours.

May 31st. Tomorrow 6:45 AM!
Dear Mother, yesterday evening we put the rings from the rope in, so I'll finish this letter now.
The thing with the relocation office is a stupid matter, how do I avoid having anything to do with it? And the grocer won't take anything anymore in summer, that is certainly a setback. I'll send you 80 the day after tomorrow, as I am partly debt-free with you. I have been for two weeks already, that is a wonderful feeling. As soon as possible I'll send you money, but I will need quite a bit for 3 C in the next weeks, I'll think about what's best to do.
The tailoring for the old suit wasn't as I expected, but he said it is quite decently hemmed. Next winter we'll start writing earlier. The gymnastics was at the evening school.
And with the color film, it's terrible that nothing came out for 24 DM, who made those things? But please do send me the roll occasionally or at least the film, and what about the ones from Niagara Falls, did nothing come of them? 24 DM is an insane amount of money, even for me. By the way, nothing on the first two films.

We were so bloody in the face, in our hair, and on our arms and legs from the mosquito bites that we couldn't stand it anymore. The next morning, Siegfried, Heinz, Dagmar, and I set out at exactly 6 o'clock in the rowboat to take photos. The lake is very large and full of countless islands, on which there is wild forest, rocks, and undergrowth. Often, one looks out over the lake from a rock, or sees wild tree roots. On the many pictures that Siegfried, Dagmar, and I took, everything can be seen clearly. At 9 o'clock we drove back to the cabins, had breakfast, played at fishing from the boat in the lake, and also fished. Then Heinz, Siegfried, and I went out again. We had seen a beautiful island that morning, where we wanted to sunbathe. However, that didn't happen, because there were so many people from the club on the lake who kept following us. When they wanted to tow us with their motorboat, Siegfried sprayed them with water. That was the best declaration of war for the ensuing water battle. First, we left our clothes, cameras, and watches on an island. Then we attacked them in our swimming trunks. They were so far out of the

how quickly we could have a house.
I also don't talk to Muchi about it, simply because she knows it better herself. I don't think she has ever seriously considered it. I believe she is quite sure of her position. She is really making huge adjustments already, almost too quickly. 1½ years is almost too long if one intends to go back and continue living there. I believe, or have the feeling, that ½ a year would be high time for her. She bravely convinces herself that she would never stay here and certainly would never be in Germany after spring. Just don't think I wanted to get rid of her, I mean, it will be very difficult for her. I believe it will be difficult to adjust again, also to German conditions, and an adjustment to smaller circumstances is much more difficult. But let's hope for the best. She really liked our ski tour, and so did I. It was really great too. We had snow and sun, unfortunately only 4 pairs of skis, so I almost didn't get to ski. And when there were skis available, my ski boots were elsewhere, as several of the girls didn't have boots. In the evening we had a masked ball, which unfortunately turned out quite poorly, as most had masks and were tired from all the fresh air. But the next afternoon before departure, we danced nicely again.

It will be harder for them to settle back into the family and adjust to it.
June 19. I just saw that the letter isn't gone.
The day before yesterday was the last time we were at the goats before the summer holidays.
On Saturday there is a big birthday celebration for Joe and Manfred and Ellen in Udora. We will stay overnight there and on Sunday morning there is competitive camp swimming in Lake Simcoe. Inge and I bought air mattresses, it's fun to be able to lie on the water for hours. Erdmuthe wrote to us recently, she's back in Wuppertal now and also gives cooking lessons, which she has to laugh about herself. We would really like to visit Christoph's cousin here, he is 10 miles away from here, and his name is Klaus Hofmann.
Warm regards from you.

Well, now, whether it's 100% certain about her holiday trip, she said that Inge's fiancé is coming on July 1st, so she naturally won't go. Isn't that something from Inge? Is that a friend with whom one can make such plans? But I've always said, that's an open-hearted and loyal friendship. I couldn't ask for a better friend than her. I'm sure that once the fiancé is here, Inge won't want to know anything more about Doris, because they will be busy with each other. I've already considered whether I should take her to B.C. with me; but that's not an option, besides, our car is probably full. And I also don't know if she wants to take such a long vacation. She is often alone in the evenings, even when I'm at home, but she doesn't know what to do with me. When the call for help comes to go out in the evening, she joins in. It's not easy, believe me, because I don't know what to do. – Recently, Uli gave a devotion for the club evening. Since Manfred always reads from the Bible, I wasn't interested at all. Uli did something really great. He is also very peace-loving, almost never goes to church, and yet he is certainly a good Christian, who always participates so nicely in the group! His devotion was about helping young people especially where it counts. I believe it touched everyone's heart, mine too. By the way, Uli helped Doris. He tore his arm open while with her and had to spend a few vacation days recovering; no one can take that back from you. This Friday I was at a school celebration at a private – Catholic – High School. Yes, and Miss O'Connor, that's my superior, has a sister there, and she asked me to send her some photos from the celebration.

laid and painted ourselves. Doris, Inge, Hilde, Mrs. Kockendörfer, Horst, Jo and Hans-Dieter are already back in Toronto at 1 PM. Doris and the Kockendörfers went to the opera in the evening. The next two drove home at 11 o'clock, so that then we and Heinz, Siegfried, Ulan-fried and I were together in a hut. The weather wasn't very great, so we drove out again for a swim. On the way home we came upon a great, lukewarm breakfast, and we arrived at the hut soaking wet. I fried bacon, cooked pea soup and coffee, it was uncomfortable. The coffee water wouldn't boil on the stove, because the oil was once all gone, so we drove to the next town to refuel, but nobody could find King, but we had so much fun with it, because the fishing rod got stuck every five minutes and in the many roots, and we didn't catch a single fish. In the evening at 9:30 PM we departed and in the morning at 3:30 AM I was in bed. I wasn't well-rested in the morning, but heavily bitten on my neck and everywhere. As a deterrent to mosquitoes and a nice memory of the 3 days. We drove so late, because between 6 and 9 PM in the evening one can hardly be on the road.

Related: a
Last weekend was Queen Victoria's birthday on Monday, for which all offices and factories were closed all three days, what is called a "long weekend" here.
On such weekends, the youth group goes on their excursions. 18 from the club drove to Deer Lake, 150 miles (225 km) away. Since I was still working on Sunday and Siegfried also until 12 o'clock, we and the youth group only set off at 3 p.m. Of course, they drove straight through, as everyone else had been gone since 7 a.m. We arrived at 7 p.m. They arrived.
And we had to drag boats to the islands, where three cottages stood. In one lived our girls and in another the boys. Mrs. Kochendörfer, Inge, Hilde, Dole, Dagmar, and I were the girls.
I immediately had a proper dinner, potato noodles and bread. By the way, we paid for the renovation ourselves, and we cooked for ourselves, which is why it was much cheaper this time. Afterwards, I drove with Horst. Now I'm with Siegfried for fishing, even though I have no interest in it, but I wanted to see if he would catch anything. He caught 3 fish, but then

Boat fell. Horst and I were in one boat, Varna, Dagmar and an engaged person in the other. The last few days we drove to our island, one practically had to commit suicide to deal with the Vileda area. We were wet/muddy, which didn't bother us, because we were the winners. On the way home, we first bathed from the boat, I in shorts and a gym shirt, because the swimming trunks are still in the shop, so comfortable. The water was wonderful, when we drove home, we saw our Vileda hanging in the trees on an island. We are proud of it, we only in the evening, when it started to rain, we slept at noon. Today I made a nice report about the whole battle. In the evening, we all ate by the boy's light, which he had gotten so stealthily. And finally, we made a campfire on an island and sang; we came home at 11:30 PM. The West huts, we acted wildly, if one doesn't register with a Jörg; the bad thing is, the horseflies are the torment in the bites. I have my whole head full of blood bites, it was bad. On Monday morning, the bed was no longer free to see, at the top the sun came along. The three of us on an island

The ski instructor and his wife were also with us; it was nice when we sat together in the evenings and sang and he played guitar, there was really a good atmosphere. We sang many such songs with refrains, and where someone sings solo; "Tedium, Oh My Eyes," and "Beautiful is a Cylindrical Hat," etc. But also beautiful folk songs. The ski instructor will build himself a hut up there in the summer. We took nice pictures; Mechi has already done some of them. Well, today Mechi is working overtime at the hospital, so she's really earning well then, that's good. She's still working there now from 4:15 to 7. She also earns quite well from the pictures. I'm also happy when she has paid off her debts, not because I need the money, but it's becoming a bit much. She has paid off her enlarger; I believe she has already paid it off herself. She certainly won't regret the purchase. What I find a bit unnecessary is that she now wants to buy skis for $18, but that's her own business. I believe our vacation to B.C. won't happen, which is a shame for Mechi, although it might have been almost financially impossible for her. With a work accident, that would have amounted to approximately $180. So we would like to

There are films that are just as good, or even better, at least in terms of their craftsmanship. "Romeo and Juliet", "Julius Caesar", "The Living Desert and The Vanishing Prairie", the two animal films by Walt Disney, "The Kidnappers", a children's film, "Doctor in the House", a medical documentary, "Adventures of Robinson Crusoe" was very beautiful. However, I haven't seen a proper medical film yet. But there are very beautiful historical films, "The Young Bess" for example, exactly like the book I have. Or "Lady Hamilton" about Lord Nelson and the Battle of Trafalgar. Then "Cleopatra" about Caesar's assassination. Apart from the symphony concerts, it's good that very good performances are always given; most of them will play on one of the evenings soon. On March 18th, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra will play here in Massey Hall. The tickets for it were already sold out in January. They are playing Handel, Brahms, Till Eulenspiegel and the Overture to Tannhäuser. The Vienna Boys' Choir will perform in April; I would really like to go there. We have now started doing pottery for some time, as that has declined due to a lack of time. We have already finished a few jars and jugs and vases, meaning some of them are not yet

Morning, May 2, 55

Dear Mother!
For your birthday, I wish you all the best.
Thank you very much for your letter, I was very happy about it. And then the sleeping bag for my birthday. It's really great. I've already put it on ten times, absolutely fantastic. We always wanted to sew some ourselves, i.e., buy the quilted blanket and then sew in the zipper; but of course, we wouldn't have had such a long zipper, and it wouldn't have been so nicely light either. With the cover, I can always have it in the front of the car. Thanks again. From myself, I got a nice wallet and a ticket for the Metropolitan Opera New York for "Carmen". Inge and Hilde and parents gave me a removable mother-of-pearl necklace, a beautiful yellow dress fabric, and also an opera ticket for "Madame Butterfly". I want to sew the dress next week. I already have the pattern. On my birthday, we were at the cinema for "The Glass Slipper" with Leslie Caron, it's the modernized fairytale of Cinderella, truly wonderful. Medi liked it very much too. On my birthday morning, I already wanted an hour

From, doesn't surprise me, because they were new. Those were even black-and-white reversal films, which I wanted to send back to Cäsar, because I want to make color slides. All this together is now an expensive pleasure, for which I at least want the film, because the cases were unique back then.
The alarm clock works perfectly, I'm so glad I got it. Of course, I sometimes place it far from the bed, but then I also get out of bed easily. If Dali doesn't hold me back, I don't sleep any longer.
I am watching my arm, my finger rapidly, to go bathing with it. Hopefully I'll be allowed to soon.
Next Monday I have to go to the dentist, I broke out a foot filling 3-4 weeks ago, that's a real mess. Firstly, the roofs are now left clear, and secondly, they are disproportionately expensive for me.
I might buy an enlarger with which I can also enlarge 6x6, because a good friend of mine bought a Rolleiflex. I've already taken passport photos for Siegfried, tonight I have to take passport photos for an acquaintance of Inge's.
So dear Mother, now I must close and go to the hospital,
I will soon again remove blame for the nonsense that I wrote with the arm and finger, which I wrote.

fired. Last time we glazed a part, now they will be fired again. But if the glazes are wet, not fired, then they look red. They turn light green when fired. That's like with color reversal in photography. The sport is still a lot of fun for us; Mich now also goes twice a week. Afterwards we always go swimming. On that occasion, Mich was in the indoor swimming pool for the first time. When I had late work hours and only came home at 7 o'clock, Mich had always cooked for me, but now her work hours are getting longer and longer. By the way, Hanny wrote to me that I look so angry in the picture I once sent. That was taken at the Christmas Men's Parade. Mich got annoyed and snapped a picture, and then she wanted to change films, and both films in both cameras were torn out, so she was angry then too; she wasn't just looking like that.
Regards. Dorle.

getting up earlier and bringing it up, I've already done that 6 times on my birthday. But Theohi says that doesn't exist, and so we argued in bed in the morning about whether I was allowed to bring it up or not. Then I looked at the clock, it was 10 minutes to 7, and at 7 o'clock I was supposed to be at work. But I just let things be and didn't get going.
Currently, Inge and Hilde's parents are here; the father is unfortunately only here for 2 weeks, he is on a business trip through the States. There are indeed a few large department stores in Germany, so he is primarily interested in the large department stores here. I think he has already connected 20 branches. He is really very nice, 57 years old, while the mother is only 29. They only got married last year, they had known each other for 10 years and only waited until the girls were older. He immediately said to me, that was nice.
On Saturday, we then went with two cars to the Füllen, accompanying Mr. Kochendörfer's trip; his wife was also with us. It was very nice, and again from a completely different point of view, namely visiting that of the rich world, where the dollars just flew away; we were, of course, all invited. For that,

Sports hall for hockey, wrestling, boxing, etc.
But the voices and sets were truly uniquely beautiful; you just notice that it's top-notch. I preferred Carmen, but perhaps only because I was too tired for Madame Butterfly, as I had slept on the floor two days before, driven 300 km, and then subsequently gone to the opera. That was on Monday, from our long weekend at Deer Lake. We were with 5 cars and had 4 cabins. The girls' cabins, however, only had 5 beds, so I slept in a sleeping bag on the floor, but I also didn't pay anything. Each cabin cooked for itself; we girls naturally fared well and cheaply. We had to leave the cars at the edge; the cabins were all on stilts; there was no electricity, only an oil lamp for lighting. One evening we had a campfire on an island; that was wonderful, there were plenty of these trees, the islands are mostly not large and so many and close together that one could easily get lost, even during the day.

I think we had 6-8 rowing boats and a motorboat. It was also already possible to swim. There was just one big drawback, the mosquitoes. Mechi got badly bitten, as did everyone who hadn't already taken a trip to the lakes. There was one person with us, Heinz, who was fishing; blood ran down his face, no exaggeration. Mechi was still swollen days later and scratched herself like crazy. However, it had been announced on the radio beforehand that one should be careful and on no account without protective oil (that's what they call it, but boys, it smells even worse than lamp oil from kitchens). We took many pictures; I took proper photos for the first time with the new camera, so I focused mainly on landscapes, apart from the titled report "Water Battle", which consists of twelve consecutive pictures of a battle. Currently, two German films are showing in English, 'The Last Recipe' with O.W. Fischer and 'The Divided Heart' with Cornel Borchers, which is about a lost Yugoslav child adopted by Germans and then after

not only my children happy, but also myself, which pleased me very much. What, by the way, strikes my comrades the most is how well they are enlarged. They are not familiar with that. – Following the celebration, I drove home with the family, so that my Miss O'Connor also came. We, a few girlfriends and acquaintances, later bowled and played. Dr. Harmuth was there, all adults, and two Germans. The father is a farmer and doesn't live in Toronto; the two sisters have a wonderful export business. There are 12 children, imagine that; one of the girls is a nurse, i.e., a Red Cross nurse in the hospitals of Korea, which is also a fulfilling profession. – I came home at 9 PM. I always enjoy it when I'm in homeopathic company, especially with Miss O'Connor; she's a truly fabulous woman. I estimate she's about 33 years old, is terribly fond of the three flowers, and she also says that she often misses the countryside, as she grew up on the farm. I believe I mostly like staying at the hospital when on assignment. For she told the Sister, who has all nurses under her, that she would have liked to be a nurse best, and imagine...

into very good circumstances, so that she will certainly be able to eat bananas and oranges there too. But I think it's nice and wise of the father to let the girls fend for themselves for once and make their own way abroad for 2 years. They haven't saved much, but at least something. Inge is expecting her fiancé in July or August. We'll see what happens. Last Sunday we were at Lake Erie on a peninsula that consisted almost entirely of sand dunes, and the sun was really burning there. I also received a long birthday letter from the Betzells. Things are also looking bad with regard to labor, although they have had a deaf and mute girl in their household for 2 years, which seems to be working quite well. But otherwise they are making progress; in recent years they have grown many useful crops, they bought a large dump trailer for the winter, and the barn will be ready soon. That makes it quite enjoyable. Now once again very heartfelt birthday greetings and all the best. However,

you could write, was that she ought to be eternally grateful to me for bringing her over. That, I believe, is the root of all evil. Sometimes she wanted to say something, then she'd think, I'm not allowed to, because I have to be grateful, and for that she then walks around offended behind one for an hour. Much more pleasant! Why do you find it strange that I can't really picture you all anymore – and by that, by the way, I didn't mean you, since you don't know me anymore either? You know, Inge and Hilde get along so well with their parents; they get a long letter every week. I don't demand that at all, because I know you have little time, but at Christmas you had time, yet you didn't want to, because I'm making it so hard for Medhi. Yet she made it just as hard for me. But you don't want to believe that of dear, wishful Medhi, do you? Inge asked me every day if I had mail, and in the end I was so ashamed that I lied to her! Well, now that's over. I'm at the point where I can tell everyone that I have no longing

is demanded back by the Yugoslav mother after 8 years. Both sides are presented in such a way that one doesn't know whose side to take, which is why it's quite sad. Do you already have the film "East of Eden" (locally umeden) by John Steinbeck? That is the best film I have seen so far, it also features a newly discovered actor. Or have you seen "On the Waterfront" with Marlon Brando? Or "Cinderella" with Leslie Caron? Medin's trip to B.C. is now set for July 1st. That's quite an experience, she will tell you a lot about it herself. She will take my Isolette for black and white and hers for color slides. Since I have vacation at exactly the same time, I can't really give her mine, unless she loses it or something else happens to it. it is easier to pay for. Yesterday Medin was offered a great job as a photographer for television broadcasting, $40 a week, which she didn't take because of B.C., I wouldn't have done that.

to have, even provisionally only for a visit, no way to go. I had actually intended to go over with Mechi. But I'd rather buy myself a sewing machine for it; at most I wanted to notice Betzel's – they at least miss me and write that, even today.

I'm also postponing decisions here; if you plan to write such, it's better to let some time pass over it. Regards Dorle (not SSD)

Don't worry about Mechi; please; we'll sort things out. Since she is so romantically inclined, I can't blame her for that. She's just indulged herself a bit. She feels very comfortable in the club, perhaps more so with you than with me. What do we do in the evenings? Mechi always writes letters and a diary; what should I tell her there? And once I begged her to come to gymnastics with me, because it's really nice there, and Mechi also wants to get thinner again. But she preferred to sort pictures,

Toronto, January 13, 1955

Dear Mother!

Yesterday your letter arrived! I will now also be completely honest. — The letter unfortunately arrived too late. I waited for it for 2 weeks, and before yesterday I then took the liberty of looking through and reading Mechi's letter, you may think what you want. After all, I wanted to know if the package had arrived at all or not. That we wouldn't know each other very well, I half expected, but that you think that way about me, that appalled me. Then for the first time I regretted that Mechi came over, because she managed that with her quick judgment. I will not let her feel that, for she probably did it unconsciously with her honesty. Heavens! Don't be afraid because of that. But for now I don't want any more letters from you, I'll forego such letters that take two weeks. Why should I be ashamed because Mechi is my sister? What nonsense! And the dumbest thing that you

Toronto, May 30, 55.

Dear Mother!

I've just read your letter, and I want to answer you right away, because I haven't written to you for a long time either. I haven't been brooding, I just wondered if I might have offended you in some way, and that's why you're not writing. It occurs to me that if Dorle even writes, she shouldn't think that I'm being kept away by you. I feel so sorry for her, because she is very alone. Inge's parents were here for the past few weeks, and they had no time at all for Dorle, which I didn't think was nice either. Dorle had lent them the car for 3 weeks, and when she wanted it back on a Sunday, she didn't get it. It could be, however, that she didn't dare to ask for her own car. She is so good-natured towards Inge, and Inge takes advantage of it. I talked to Manfred about it, he's of the same opinion. One must also remember that I wrote at the beginning of my time in Canada that Dorle and Inge were going to the West. When it was time to start the vacation, Inge suddenly didn't want to anymore and was very grumpy. Dorle didn't either, even though I would have gone along. But then they both postponed their vacation until July 1st and wanted to drive all the way west by car to Halifax. They asked if I wanted to come along, but honestly, that wouldn't be a vacation for me. The vacation with the trip to the West is now fixed, and they might even go in July, and that's why we haven't talked about it lately. Recently asked

And on top of that, she had two days off ahead of her. I simply don't drive out for myself in winter either, but for Mechi. Why didn't I let her drive? When she must have written that to you, we had only ever been in the Toronto city district with the car. Her driver's license isn't valid, I told her that on the first day. If we had been caught, if Mechi were driving without a license, I would have my driver's license taken away for half a year, and if an accident happens, even if she has a driver's license, no insurance will pay, because the insurance only covers me. So I will always be scared when Mechi drives, not because she doesn't drive well (she shifts very well), but because in this traffic, an accident can happen to anyone, and even if she's not at fault, the insurance will fight for its rights for as long as it wants until the uninsured person has to pay. An accident repair costs at least 300 - 400 dollars; the Volkswagen would be immediately totaled anyway. I simply cannot afford that. But she drives it anyway.

---

to Nova Scotia and I to the North, that will certainly be very nice too. Inge will also participate. Mech is not very enthusiastic about it, but it often happens that one has disagreements with his wife, whom he understands better than his sister, especially since we did a lot together last summer. Next week we will go to the opera, and on March 3rd we are invited to Uli's birthday party – 12 from our group. We want to give him an air mattress or a sleeping bag, which can be put to good use on the next trip. Inge and Hilde are already beside themselves with excitement. Their mother is coming on Good Friday by plane and will stay for 7 weeks and then return to Germany with their father. Today they bought a couch and made a tea table; they received the money for it back from overpaid taxes. That is certainly more pleasant than for me last year, when I had to pay an additional $42. I recently saw "Desiree" by Brando here, which was good. But even better was "On the Waterfront" (Marlon Brando), which in Germany is called, I believe, "Die Faust im Nacken".

Toronto, June 2nd
55

Dear Mother and Siblings!
I was very happy about the post-birthday letter and thank you very much. The jug was unfortunately still in the oven for firing, but I have sent it off now. That firing takes quite a long time, then we glazed them on the last day of school – and then our screaming was no longer there. I also have the record with Hungarian Dances, 16 dances on one record, played by Jascha Heifetz. Didn't you also know Jascha Heifetz and Jehudi Menuhin? I already heard both of them here last year, they are the two best violinists in the world. Mechi is almost still asking me now
I have already renewed my subscription for next autumn and winter for the symphony concert. Mechi thinks she will fall asleep. The program will be very good. 5 of the best conductors in the world are coming, Heifetz and Rubinstein (violin and piano). I'm already looking forward to that again. From the Metropolitan Opera I saw "Madame Butterfly" and "Carmen". The hall is not very big, nice for the purpose, it is actually

We then also saw something and ate well on the 12th floor of the most distinguished milling hotel with a view of the Falls. We rode all the elevators and railways through/under the Falls; only the two ships that sailed below the Falls were not there, because they had burned down completely two weeks before the season. That was a much-discussed event. The ships had been built down there over 50 years ago, as they couldn't be brought in fully assembled. That is a huge loss of business if they can no longer operate. Just imagine, Hilde is returning to Germany with her mother on June 30th. This is rather sudden, but her father wants her back because she has lost so much weight so suddenly and is so nervous; it's better this way. She also has a better life over there. Later, she is supposed to go to French Switzerland for a year to learn French. But she is leaving all her things here, as she might come back if she doesn't like it over there anymore. I wonder how she will settle back in over there, but as I said, she's going over there...

The traffic was so heavy after such a weekend, and 1 PM was just too much for us. The last day, moreover, was the most beautiful.
Last week I was busy every evening developing film and enlarging pictures, which is why I didn't write sooner. – In the hospital, I was rubbed with salt water, Netron, and all sorts of remedies, because I looked bad. Now almost everything is over, only one spot is a bit irritated; thankfully it wasn't an infection, that goes away very quickly. – By the way, from July 15th I'll be at the spa for a holiday, it's a better feeling after all.
This Sunday, Siegfried, Enke, Dole and I were at Klang, at Lahe Umbolz; it was nice, though too short. Siegfried and I went swimming, the water is fresh but lovely.
You know, I've had such lazy Sundays as long as I can remember, and I wish all of you the same from the bottom of my heart. Or it's also pointless if I can't participate, and you don't gain anything from that either. I just want to make as much time for you as possible.
Imagine, last week 'The Last Recipe' starring O. W. Fischer played here. Siegfried was there; I've been to the cinema very, very little.
Maybe there's something at the Baltic Sea.
If I don't go on this holiday, then I'll wait. Or do you have another plan, then tell me soon.

...Unfortunately, her brother had an accident on that very day, so she couldn't come along herself. I left the hospital at 2:30 PM and met her parents and her sister at the school. (Her sister is also a nurse in our hospital, etc., from Perth, Denwich.) I didn't go to the 3rd row where all the teachers, all the priests and nuns were sitting, and I looked around. The priests were so nice; they let me sit on a chair so I could see something. The girls wear long white dresses and all receive a crown; the whole thing is like with us. But otherwise it's the same, like a student ceremony, called Graduation: a speech is given, as is one by the Director, prizes are distributed, choirs sing, and a girl played along with a drum recording. A band also gathered, and everyone met in the school's backyard. The graduates receive gifts from their friends and acquaintances; they congratulate each other. At a beloved buffet table, everyone can take sandwiches, cake, and punch as much as they want. And above all, photos are taken, not as photographed. With my recording, not...
