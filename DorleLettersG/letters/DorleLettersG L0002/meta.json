  "reason": "This letter starts with 'Toronto, Feb. 24, 55' and 'Liebe Mutti!'. The content flows from an apology for a previous letter to discussions about Mechi's adjustment, a ski trip, photography, upcoming social events (Uli's birthday), and activities like pottery and swimming. The final page concludes with a closing 'gruß. Dorli.'."
