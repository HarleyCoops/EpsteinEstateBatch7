  "reason": "These pages form a coherent letter discussing recent events. It starts by mentioning mosquito problems on a trip, discusses German films showing locally, then details Mechi's travel plans to B.C. and a job offer she declined. The final page continues the discussion about Hilde and Inge's situations, creating a logical flow of topics."
