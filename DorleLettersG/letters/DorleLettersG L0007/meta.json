  "reason": "These pages form a coherent narrative. The first page describes a trip to a lake with mosquitos and mentions two German films. The second page continues the discussion of films ('East of Eden') and then talks about Mechi's upcoming trip to B.C. and a job offer she declined. The third page continues discussing Mechi's travel plans and compares Hilde's and Inge's situations. The flow of topics is logical, but there is no date, salutation, or signature."
