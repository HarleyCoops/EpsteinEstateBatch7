  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reason": "This letter starts with 'Toronto, May 30th, 55.' and 'Liebe Mutter!'. It discusses relationship dynamics with Dorle and Inge, a club event, and attending a Catholic high school graduation. The pages are linked by the graduation event, which is described across multiple pages (marked II and III). The final page has a postscript dated 'Juni 19.' and ends with 'Herzliche Grüße von Dirk', which is likely a typo for Doris/Dorli."
