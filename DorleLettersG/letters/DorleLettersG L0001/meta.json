  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reason": "This letter starts with the date '13.1.55.' and a salutation to 'Liebe Mutter!'. The content is a very emotional and consistent complaint about a letter from the mother, influenced by 'Mechi'. The pages flow logically, discussing the writer's feelings of being misunderstood, her relationship with Mechi, and practical issues like Mechi driving the car. The tone is consistent throughout."
