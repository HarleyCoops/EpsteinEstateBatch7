  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reason": "The first page, dated May 31st, discusses finances ('P 60'), a failed color film, and ski trips. The second page continues the theme of failed films ('schwarz-weiß-Umkehrfilme'), mentions a working alarm clock, a broken watch, a pending dentist visit, and photography equipment. The thematic overlap of photography and finances suggests they belong to the same letter."
