  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reason": "This letter starts on June 2, 1955, mentioning opera visits ('Madame Butterfly', 'Carmen') and a recent trip to Deer Lake. The following pages provide a detailed, multi-page account of this trip, which took place over the Queen Victoria's birthday long weekend. The narrative flows from the arrival, the 'Wasserschlacht' (water fight), mosquito bites, and the late drive home. The final page discusses the aftermath of the mosquito bites and other recent activities."
