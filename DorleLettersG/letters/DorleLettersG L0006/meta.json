  "reason": "The first page is dated 'Way 31st. mayen' (likely May 31st) and discusses sending money, a ski trip, and problems with color film. The second page continues the topic of photography (color film, enlarger) and mentions a broken watch and a dentist appointment. The topics are consistent with a personal update letter, and the flow seems logical, though there is no explicit salutation or closing signature."
