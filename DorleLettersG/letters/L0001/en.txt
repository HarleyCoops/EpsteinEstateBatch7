Toronto, January 13, 1955.

Dear Mother,
Your letter arrived yesterday! Now I'm going
to be completely honest, too. – Unfortunately,
the letter came too late. I waited two weeks
for it, and the day before yesterday I just
went ahead and read Mechi's letter without
permission, you can think what you will.
After all, I wanted to know if the package
had even arrived or not. I had half-figured
that we wouldn't know each other very well,
but I was horrified that you think of me
that way. That was the first time I regretted
that Mechi came over here, because she managed
that with her quick judgment. I won't let her
feel it, because she probably did it
unconsciously with her obsession for honesty.
Don't worry about it. But for the time being,
I don't want any more letters from you; I can
do without letters that take two weeks to
write. Why should I be ashamed that Mechi
is my sister? What nonsense. And the stupidest
thing you could have written was that she should
be eternally grateful to me for bringing her
over. Therein, I believe, lies the whole
problem. Sometimes she wanted to say something,
then she thinks, I can't do that because
I have to be grateful, and instead she walks
around behind you, offended, for an hour.
So much more pleasant! What do you think, is it
strange that I can no longer properly picture
you all, by which, incidentally, I didn't mean you,
since you don't know me anymore either?
You know, Inge and Hilde get along so
well with their parents; they get a long letter
every week. I don't ask for that at all,
because I know you have little time, but at
Christmas you had time, but you didn't want to,
because I'm making it so hard for Mechi, even though
she was making it just as hard for me, but
you wouldn't want to believe that of the dear,
spunky Mechi. Inge asked me every day
if I had mail, and in the end I was so ashamed
that I lied to her! But now that's
over. I've reached the point where I can tell
anyone that I'm not homesick, and for now
I only plan to go home for a visit. I had actually
planned to travel over with Mechi,
but I'd rather buy a sewing machine
with the money instead, unless I were to get
an order from the Befehls; at least they miss me
and write that, even today.
I don't need your apologies, in case you're
planning to write any; it's better to just
let some time pass.
It’s better this way.
Don't worry about Mechi, please; we'll
sort things out. Since she has such an
unrealistically romantic nature, I can't
hold it against her; she just felt a little
sorry for herself. She feels very comfortable
at the club, more so than with me. What do we
do in the evenings? Mechi is always writing
letters and her diary, so what am I supposed to
talk to her about? And one time I begged her
to come to gymnastics with me, because it's
really nice there, and Mechi wants to get
thinner again, too. But she'd rather sort pictures,
