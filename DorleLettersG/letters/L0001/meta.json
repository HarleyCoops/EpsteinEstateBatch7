  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reason": "This letter, dated January 13, 1955, is a direct and emotional response to a letter from the mother. The author expresses hurt over the mother's perception, which seems influenced by 'Mechi'. The pages flow logically from the initial reaction to the mother's letter, to a discussion of the difficult relationship with Mechi, and finally to a plea for understanding regarding Mechi's behavior."
