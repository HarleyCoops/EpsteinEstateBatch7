She could have also stopped working a bit earlier next spring and then traveled via B.C. and California to Europe. In that position, she would have had every Sunday off and every second weekend from Friday to Tuesday. And that certainly would have been interesting work. She also said that wasn't enough, $40 a week. That's an hourly wage of $1.00, and back then I worked on the farm for 35¢ an hour and thought, wow, what I was saving and earning. But that's another matter.
Yes, Hilde and Mrs. Kochen are allowed to return on July 1st. Hilde had business school in Germany, so she's actually professionally suited for this bank, while Inge trained as a textile technician at the textile school and also sewed and co-designed costumes and dresses for a film studio in Wiesbaden for 3 years. For Hilde, the adjustment won't be as drastic, because she will be living in better circumstances in Germany again than here; she's just dreading the long working hours.
