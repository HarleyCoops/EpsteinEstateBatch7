The traffic was so heavy after such a weekend, and 1 PM was just too much for us. The last day, moreover, was the most beautiful.
Last week I was busy every evening developing film and enlarging pictures, which is why I didn't write sooner. – In the hospital, I was rubbed with salt water, Netron, and all sorts of remedies, because I looked bad. Now almost everything is over, only one spot is a bit irritated; thankfully it wasn't an infection, that goes away very quickly. – By the way, from July 15th I'll be at the spa for a holiday, it's a better feeling after all.
This Sunday, Siegfried, Enke, Dole and I were at Klang, at Lahe Umbolz; it was nice, though too short. Siegfried and I went swimming, the water is fresh but lovely.
You know, I've had such lazy Sundays as long as I can remember, and I wish all of you the same from the bottom of my heart. Or it's also pointless if I can't participate, and you don't gain anything from that either. I just want to make as much time for you as possible.
Imagine, last week 'The Last Recipe' starring O. W. Fischer played here. Siegfried was there; I've been to the cinema very, very little.
Maybe there's something at the Baltic Sea.
If I don't go on this holiday, then I'll wait. Or do you have another plan, then tell me soon.
