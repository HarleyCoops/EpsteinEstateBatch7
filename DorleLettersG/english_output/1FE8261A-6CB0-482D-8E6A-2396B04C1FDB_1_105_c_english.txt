Dear Mother!
For your birthday, I wish you all the best.
Thank you very much for your letter, I was very happy about it. And then the sleeping bag for my birthday. It's really great. I've already put it on ten times, absolutely fantastic. We always wanted to sew some ourselves, i.e., buy the quilted blanket and then sew in the zipper; but of course, we wouldn't have had such a long zipper, and it wouldn't have been so nicely light either. With the cover, I can always have it in the front of the car. Thanks again. From myself, I got a nice wallet and a ticket for the Metropolitan Opera New York for "Carmen". Inge and Hilde and parents gave me a removable mother-of-pearl necklace, a beautiful yellow dress fabric, and also an opera ticket for "Madame Butterfly". I want to sew the dress next week. I already have the pattern. On my birthday, we were at the cinema for "The Glass Slipper" with Leslie Caron, it's the modernized fairytale of Cinderella, truly wonderful. Medi liked it very much too. On my birthday morning, I already wanted an hour
