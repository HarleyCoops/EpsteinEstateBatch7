to Nova Scotia and I to the North, that will certainly be very nice too. Inge will also participate. Mech is not very enthusiastic about it, but it often happens that one has disagreements with his wife, whom he understands better than his sister, especially since we did a lot together last summer. Next week we will go to the opera, and on March 3rd we are invited to Uli's birthday party – 12 from our group. We want to give him an air mattress or a sleeping bag, which can be put to good use on the next trip. Inge and Hilde are already beside themselves with excitement. Their mother is coming on Good Friday by plane and will stay for 7 weeks and then return to Germany with their father. Today they bought a couch and made a tea table; they received the money for it back from overpaid taxes. That is certainly more pleasant than for me last year, when I had to pay an additional $42. I recently saw "Desiree" by Brando here, which was good. But even better was "On the Waterfront" (Marlon Brando), which in Germany is called, I believe, "Die Faust im Nacken".
