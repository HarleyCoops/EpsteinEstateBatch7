Well, now, whether it's 100% certain about her holiday trip, she said that Inge's fiancé is coming on July 1st, so she naturally won't go. Isn't that something from Inge? Is that a friend with whom one can make such plans? But I've always said, that's an open-hearted and loyal friendship. I couldn't ask for a better friend than her. I'm sure that once the fiancé is here, Inge won't want to know anything more about Doris, because they will be busy with each other. I've already considered whether I should take her to B.C. with me; but that's not an option, besides, our car is probably full. And I also don't know if she wants to take such a long vacation. She is often alone in the evenings, even when I'm at home, but she doesn't know what to do with me. When the call for help comes to go out in the evening, she joins in. It's not easy, believe me, because I don't know what to do. – Recently, Uli gave a devotion for the club evening. Since Manfred always reads from the Bible, I wasn't interested at all. Uli did something really great. He is also very peace-loving, almost never goes to church, and yet he is certainly a good Christian, who always participates so nicely in the group! His devotion was about helping young people especially where it counts. I believe it touched everyone's heart, mine too. By the way, Uli helped Doris. He tore his arm open while with her and had to spend a few vacation days recovering; no one can take that back from you. This Friday I was at a school celebration at a private – Catholic – High School. Yes, and Miss O'Connor, that's my superior, has a sister there, and she asked me to send her some photos from the celebration.
