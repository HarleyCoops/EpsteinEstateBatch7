Toronto, May 30, 55.

Dear Mother!

I've just read your letter, and I want to answer you right away, because I haven't written to you for a long time either. I haven't been brooding, I just wondered if I might have offended you in some way, and that's why you're not writing. It occurs to me that if Dorle even writes, she shouldn't think that I'm being kept away by you. I feel so sorry for her, because she is very alone. Inge's parents were here for the past few weeks, and they had no time at all for Dorle, which I didn't think was nice either. Dorle had lent them the car for 3 weeks, and when she wanted it back on a Sunday, she didn't get it. It could be, however, that she didn't dare to ask for her own car. She is so good-natured towards Inge, and Inge takes advantage of it. I talked to Manfred about it, he's of the same opinion. One must also remember that I wrote at the beginning of my time in Canada that Dorle and Inge were going to the West. When it was time to start the vacation, Inge suddenly didn't want to anymore and was very grumpy. Dorle didn't either, even though I would have gone along. But then they both postponed their vacation until July 1st and wanted to drive all the way west by car to Halifax. They asked if I wanted to come along, but honestly, that wouldn't be a vacation for me. The vacation with the trip to the West is now fixed, and they might even go in July, and that's why we haven't talked about it lately. Recently asked
