We then also saw something and ate well on the 12th floor of the most distinguished milling hotel with a view of the Falls. We rode all the elevators and railways through/under the Falls; only the two ships that sailed below the Falls were not there, because they had burned down completely two weeks before the season. That was a much-discussed event. The ships had been built down there over 50 years ago, as they couldn't be brought in fully assembled. That is a huge loss of business if they can no longer operate. Just imagine, Hilde is returning to Germany with her mother on June 30th. This is rather sudden, but her father wants her back because she has lost so much weight so suddenly and is so nervous; it's better this way. She also has a better life over there. Later, she is supposed to go to French Switzerland for a year to learn French. But she is leaving all her things here, as she might come back if she doesn't like it over there anymore. I wonder how she will settle back in over there, but as I said, she's going over there...
