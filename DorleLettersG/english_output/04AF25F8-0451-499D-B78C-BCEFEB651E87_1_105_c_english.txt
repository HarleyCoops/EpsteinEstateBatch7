Boat fell. Horst and I were in one boat, Varna, Dagmar and an engaged person in the other. The last few days we drove to our island, one practically had to commit suicide to deal with the Vileda area. We were wet/muddy, which didn't bother us, because we were the winners. On the way home, we first bathed from the boat, I in shorts and a gym shirt, because the swimming trunks are still in the shop, so comfortable. The water was wonderful, when we drove home, we saw our Vileda hanging in the trees on an island. We are proud of it, we only in the evening, when it started to rain, we slept at noon. Today I made a nice report about the whole battle. In the evening, we all ate by the boy's light, which he had gotten so stealthily. And finally, we made a campfire on an island and sang; we came home at 11:30 PM. The West huts, we acted wildly, if one doesn't register with a Jörg; the bad thing is, the horseflies are the torment in the bites. I have my whole head full of blood bites, it was bad. On Monday morning, the bed was no longer free to see, at the top the sun came along. The three of us on an island
