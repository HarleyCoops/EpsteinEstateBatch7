laid and painted ourselves. Doris, Inge, Hilde, Mrs. Kockendörfer, Horst, Jo and Hans-Dieter are already back in Toronto at 1 PM. Doris and the Kockendörfers went to the opera in the evening. The next two drove home at 11 o'clock, so that then we and Heinz, Siegfried, Ulan-fried and I were together in a hut. The weather wasn't very great, so we drove out again for a swim. On the way home we came upon a great, lukewarm breakfast, and we arrived at the hut soaking wet. I fried bacon, cooked pea soup and coffee, it was uncomfortable. The coffee water wouldn't boil on the stove, because the oil was once all gone, so we drove to the next town to refuel, but nobody could find King, but we had so much fun with it, because the fishing rod got stuck every five minutes and in the many roots, and we didn't catch a single fish. In the evening at 9:30 PM we departed and in the morning at 3:30 AM I was in bed. I wasn't well-rested in the morning, but heavily bitten on my neck and everywhere. As a deterrent to mosquitoes and a nice memory of the 3 days. We drove so late, because between 6 and 9 PM in the evening one can hardly be on the road.
