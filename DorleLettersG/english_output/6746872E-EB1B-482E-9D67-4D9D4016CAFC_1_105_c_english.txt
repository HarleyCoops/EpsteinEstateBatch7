But the voices and sets were truly uniquely beautiful; you just notice that it's top-notch. I preferred Carmen, but perhaps only because I was too tired for Madame Butterfly, as I had slept on the floor two days before, driven 300 km, and then subsequently gone to the opera. That was on Monday, from our long weekend at Deer Lake. We were with 5 cars and had 4 cabins. The girls' cabins, however, only had 5 beds, so I slept in a sleeping bag on the floor, but I also didn't pay anything. Each cabin cooked for itself; we girls naturally fared well and cheaply. We had to leave the cars at the edge; the cabins were all on stilts; there was no electricity, only an oil lamp for lighting. One evening we had a campfire on an island; that was wonderful, there were plenty of these trees, the islands are mostly not large and so many and close together that one could easily get lost, even during the day.
