May 31st. Tomorrow 6:45 AM!
Dear Mother, yesterday evening we put the rings from the rope in, so I'll finish this letter now.
The thing with the relocation office is a stupid matter, how do I avoid having anything to do with it? And the grocer won't take anything anymore in summer, that is certainly a setback. I'll send you 80 the day after tomorrow, as I am partly debt-free with you. I have been for two weeks already, that is a wonderful feeling. As soon as possible I'll send you money, but I will need quite a bit for 3 C in the next weeks, I'll think about what's best to do.
The tailoring for the old suit wasn't as I expected, but he said it is quite decently hemmed. Next winter we'll start writing earlier. The gymnastics was at the evening school.
And with the color film, it's terrible that nothing came out for 24 DM, who made those things? But please do send me the roll occasionally or at least the film, and what about the ones from Niagara Falls, did nothing come of them? 24 DM is an insane amount of money, even for me. By the way, nothing on the first two films.
