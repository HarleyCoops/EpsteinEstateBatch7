And on top of that, she had two days off ahead of her. I simply don't drive out for myself in winter either, but for Mechi. Why didn't I let her drive? When she must have written that to you, we had only ever been in the Toronto city district with the car. Her driver's license isn't valid, I told her that on the first day. If we had been caught, if Mechi were driving without a license, I would have my driver's license taken away for half a year, and if an accident happens, even if she has a driver's license, no insurance will pay, because the insurance only covers me. So I will always be scared when Mechi drives, not because she doesn't drive well (she shifts very well), but because in this traffic, an accident can happen to anyone, and even if she's not at fault, the insurance will fight for its rights for as long as it wants until the uninsured person has to pay. An accident repair costs at least 300 - 400 dollars; the Volkswagen would be immediately totaled anyway. I simply cannot afford that. But she drives it anyway.
