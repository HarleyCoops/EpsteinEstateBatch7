fired. Last time we glazed a part, now they will be fired again. But if the glazes are wet, not fired, then they look red. They turn light green when fired. That's like with color reversal in photography. The sport is still a lot of fun for us; Mich now also goes twice a week. Afterwards we always go swimming. On that occasion, Mich was in the indoor swimming pool for the first time. When I had late work hours and only came home at 7 o'clock, Mich had always cooked for me, but now her work hours are getting longer and longer. By the way, Hanny wrote to me that I look so angry in the picture I once sent. That was taken at the Christmas Men's Parade. Mich got annoyed and snapped a picture, and then she wanted to change films, and both films in both cameras were torn out, so she was angry then too; she wasn't just looking like that.
Regards. Dorle.
