It will be harder for them to settle back into the family and adjust to it.
June 19. I just saw that the letter isn't gone.
The day before yesterday was the last time we were at the goats before the summer holidays.
On Saturday there is a big birthday celebration for Joe and Manfred and Ellen in Udora. We will stay overnight there and on Sunday morning there is competitive camp swimming in Lake Simcoe. Inge and I bought air mattresses, it's fun to be able to lie on the water for hours. Erdmuthe wrote to us recently, she's back in Wuppertal now and also gives cooking lessons, which she has to laugh about herself. We would really like to visit Christoph's cousin here, he is 10 miles away from here, and his name is Klaus Hofmann.
Warm regards from you.
