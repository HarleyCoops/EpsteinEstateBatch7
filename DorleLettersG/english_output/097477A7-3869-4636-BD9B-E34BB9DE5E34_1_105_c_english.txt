to have, even provisionally only for a visit, no way to go. I had actually intended to go over with Mechi. But I'd rather buy myself a sewing machine for it; at most I wanted to notice Betzel's – they at least miss me and write that, even today.

I'm also postponing decisions here; if you plan to write such, it's better to let some time pass over it. Regards Dorle (not SSD)

Don't worry about Mechi; please; we'll sort things out. Since she is so romantically inclined, I can't blame her for that. She's just indulged herself a bit. She feels very comfortable in the club, perhaps more so with you than with me. What do we do in the evenings? Mechi always writes letters and a diary; what should I tell her there? And once I begged her to come to gymnastics with me, because it's really nice there, and Mechi also wants to get thinner again. But she preferred to sort pictures,
