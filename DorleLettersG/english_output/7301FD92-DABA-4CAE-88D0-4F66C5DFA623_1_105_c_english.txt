how quickly we could have a house.
I also don't talk to Muchi about it, simply because she knows it better herself. I don't think she has ever seriously considered it. I believe she is quite sure of her position. She is really making huge adjustments already, almost too quickly. 1½ years is almost too long if one intends to go back and continue living there. I believe, or have the feeling, that ½ a year would be high time for her. She bravely convinces herself that she would never stay here and certainly would never be in Germany after spring. Just don't think I wanted to get rid of her, I mean, it will be very difficult for her. I believe it will be difficult to adjust again, also to German conditions, and an adjustment to smaller circumstances is much more difficult. But let's hope for the best. She really liked our ski tour, and so did I. It was really great too. We had snow and sun, unfortunately only 4 pairs of skis, so I almost didn't get to ski. And when there were skis available, my ski boots were elsewhere, as several of the girls didn't have boots. In the evening we had a masked ball, which unfortunately turned out quite poorly, as most had masks and were tired from all the fresh air. But the next afternoon before departure, we danced nicely again.
