Dear Mother!
I want to apologize for my letter, I am sorry. I had indeed thought too selfishly then. I will certainly not do that again. It may well be that I clearly concealed everything back then. One shouldn't just send off bad or unpleasant things right away, but wait until everything has cooled down a bit. I didn't know that my Christmas letter, which I had sent before Michi, hadn't arrived, so please apologize again. Please don't think that I was like that when we, the Eber children, had it. And when I suggested back then whether you all wouldn't want to come, it wasn't so much because you would have it easier then, nor because I felt guilty about it, as I had actually promised to come back. I had firmly decided that back then in Germany; at Betzel's I also liked the outdoor work, by the way, still do today. What can I help it if I like it so much here. At the beginning, I resisted this thought often enough & I haven't really talked about it yet whether it's advisable for you all to come over, except that we calculated it.
