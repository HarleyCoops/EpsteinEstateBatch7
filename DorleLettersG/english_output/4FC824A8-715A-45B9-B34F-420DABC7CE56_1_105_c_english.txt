The alarm clock works perfectly, I'm so glad I got it. Of course, I sometimes place it far from the bed, but then I also get out of bed easily. If Dali doesn't hold me back, I don't sleep any longer.

I might buy an enlarger with which I can also enlarge 6x6, because a good friend of mine bought a Rolleiflex. I've already taken passport photos for Siegfried, tonight I have to take passport photos for an acquaintance of Inge's.
