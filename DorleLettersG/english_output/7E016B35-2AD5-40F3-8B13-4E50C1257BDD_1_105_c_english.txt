is demanded back by the Yugoslav mother after 8 years. Both sides are presented in such a way that one doesn't know whose side to take, which is why it's quite sad. Do you already have the film "East of Eden" (locally umeden) by John Steinbeck? That is the best film I have seen so far, it also features a newly discovered actor. Or have you seen "On the Waterfront" with Marlon Brando? Or "Cinderella" with Leslie Caron? Medin's trip to B.C. is now set for July 1st. That's quite an experience, she will tell you a lot about it herself. She will take my Isolette for black and white and hers for color slides. Since I have vacation at exactly the same time, I can't really give her mine, unless she loses it or something else happens to it. it is easier to pay for. Yesterday Medin was offered a great job as a photographer for television broadcasting, $40 a week, which she didn't take because of B.C., I wouldn't have done that.
